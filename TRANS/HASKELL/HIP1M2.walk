HIP2M6: The Gremlin's Domain.

#1:) Down the stairs from the beginning of the level, there is an Ogre behind some metal bars. Shoot the wall to the right to open it and gain access to a staircase leading up to the Ogre and some yellow armor.
#2:) In the square room with the metal grate leading to water, located down the stairs to the left of the gold key door, turn around to face the stairs and look up. Shoot the button on the ceiling and the pillar in the middle of the room with the gold key door will lower, revealing a 100 Health pickup.
