Chapter 8
Functions and Closures
When programs get larger, you need some way to divide them into smaller, more manageable pieces.
For dividing up control flow, Scala offers an approach familiar to all experienced programmers: divide
the code into functions. In fact, Scala offers several ways to define functions that are not present in
Java. Besides methods, which are functions that are members of some object, there are also functions
nested within functions, function literals, and function values. This chapter takes you on a tour through
all of these flavors of functions in Scala.
8.1 METHODS
The most common way to define a function is as a member of some object; such a function is called
a method. As an example, Listing 8.1 shows two methods that together read a file with a given name
and print out all lines whose length exceeds a given width. Every printed line is prefixed with the name
of the file it appears in.
import scala.io.Source
object LongLines {
def processFile(filename: String, width: Int) = {
val source = Source.fromFile(filename)
for (line <- source.getLines())
processLine(filename, width, line)
}
private def processLine(filename: String,
width: Int, line: String) = {
if (line.length > width)
println(filename + ": " + line.trim)
}
}
Listing 8.1 - LongLines with a private processLine method.
The processFile method takes a filename and width as parameters. It creates a Source object from the
file name and, in the generator of the for expression, calls getLines on the source. As mentioned in Step
12 of Chapter 3, getLines returns an iterator that provides one line from the file on each iteration,
excluding the end-of-line character. The for expression processes each of these lines by calling the
helper method, processLine. The processLine method takes three parameters: a filename, a width, and
a line. It tests whether the length of the line is greater than the given width, and, if so, it prints the
filename, a colon, and the line.
To use LongLines from the command line, we'll create an application that expects the line width as the
first command-line argument, and interprets subsequent arguments as filenames:footnote:[In this book, we usually won't check command-line arguments for validity in example applications, both to save trees and reduce boilerplate code that can obscure the example's important code. The trade-off is that instead of producing a helpful error message when given bad input, our example applications will throw an exception.]object FindLongLines {
def main(args: Array[String]) = {
val width = args(0).toInt
for (arg <- args.drop(1))
LongLines.processFile(arg, width)
}
}
Here's how you'd use this application to find the lines in LongLines.scala that are over 45 characters in
length (there's just one):
$ scala FindLongLines 45 LongLines.scala
LongLines.scala: def processFile(filename: String, width: Int) = {
So far, this is very similar to what you would do in any object-oriented language. However, the concept
of a function in Scala is more general than a method. Scala's other ways to express functions will be
explained in the following sections.
8.2 LOCAL FUNCTIONS
The construction of the processFile method in the previous section demonstrated an important design
principle of the functional programming style: programs should be decomposed into many small
functions that each do a well-defined task. Individual functions are often quite small. The advantage of
this style is that it gives a programmer many building blocks that can be flexibly composed to do more
difficult things. Each building block should be simple enough to be understood individually.
One problem with this approach is that all the helper function names can pollute the program
namespace. In the interpreter this is not so much of a problem, but once functions are packaged in
reusable classes and objects, it's desirable to hide the helper functions from clients of a class. They
often do not make sense individually, and you often want to keep enough flexibility to delete the helper
functions if you later rewrite the class a different way.
In Java, your main tool for this purpose is the private method. This private-method approach works in
Scala as well, as demonstrated in Listing 8.1, but Scala offers an additional approach: you can define
functions inside other functions. Just like local variables, such local functions are visible only in their
enclosing block. Here's an example:
def processFile(filename: String, width: Int) = {
def processLine(filename: String,
width: Int, line: String) = {
}
}
if (line.length > width)
println(filename + ": " + line.trim)
val source = Source.fromFile(filename)
for (line <- source.getLines()) {
processLine(filename, width, line)
}In this example, we refactored the original LongLines version, shown in Listing 8.1, by transforming
private method, processLine, into a local function of processFile. To do so we removed
the private modifier, which can only be applied (and is only needed) for members, and placed the
definition of processLine inside the definition of processFile. As a local function,processLine is in
scope inside processFile, but inaccessible outside.
Now that processLine is defined inside processFile, however, another improvement becomes possible.
Notice how filename and width are passed unchanged into the helper function? This is not necessary
because local functions can access the parameters of their enclosing function. You can just use the
parameters of the outer processLine function, as shown in Listing 8.2.
import scala.io.Source
object LongLines {
def processFile(filename: String, width: Int) = {
def processLine(line: String) = {
if (line.length > width)
println(filename + ": " + line.trim)
}
}
val source = Source.fromFile(filename)
for (line <- source.getLines())
processLine(line)
}
Listing 8.2 - LongLines with a local processLine function.
Simpler, isn't it? This use of an enclosing function's parameters is a common and useful example of the
general nesting Scala provides. The nesting and scoping described in Section 7.7 applies to all Scala
constructs, including functions. It's a simple principle, but very powerful, especially in a language with
first-class functions.
8.3 FIRST-CLASS FUNCTIONS
Scala has first-class functions. Not only can you define functions and call them, but you can write
down functions as unnamed literals and then pass them around as values. We introduced function
literals in Chapter 2 and showed the basic syntax in Figure 2.2 here.
A function literal is compiled into a class that when instantiated at runtime is a function value.footnote:[Every function value is an instance of some class that extends one of several FunctionNtraits in package scala, such as Function0 for functions with no parameters, Function1 for functions with one parameter, and so on. Each FunctionN trait has an apply method used to invoke the function.] Thus
the distinction between function literals and values is that function literals exist in the source code,
whereas function values exist as objects at runtime. The distinction is much like that between classes
(source code) and objects (runtime).
Here is a simple example of a function literal that adds one to a number:
(x: Int) => x + 1The => designates that this function converts the thing on the left (any integer x) to the thing on the
right (x + 1). So, this is a function mapping any integer x to x + 1.
Function values are objects, so you can store them in variables if you like. They are functions, too, so
you can invoke them using the usual parentheses function-call notation. Here is an example of both
activities:
scala> var increase = (x: Int) => x + 1
increase: Int => Int = <function1>
scala> increase(10)
res0: Int = 11
Because increase, in this example, is a var, you can assign a different function value to it later on.
scala> increase = (x: Int) => x + 9999
increase: Int => Int = <function1>
scala> increase(10)
res1: Int = 10009
If you want to have more than one statement in the function literal, surround its body by curly braces
and put one statement per line, thus forming a block. Just like a method, when the function value is
invoked, all of the statements will be executed, and the value returned from the function is whatever
results from evaluating the last expression.
scala> increase = (x: Int) => {
println("We")
println("are")
println("here!")
x + 1
}
increase: Int => Int = <function1>
scala> increase(10)
We
are
here!
res2: Int = 11
So now you have seen the nuts and bolts of function literals and function values. Many Scala libraries
give you opportunities to use them. For example, a foreach method is available for all collections.footnote:[A foreach method is defined in trait Traversable, a common supertrait of List, Set, Array, andMap. See Chapter 17 for the details.] It
takes a function as an argument and invokes that function on each of its elements. Here is how it can be
used to print out all of the elements of a list:
scala> val someNumbers = List(-11, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10)
someNumbers: List[Int] = List(-11, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10)
scala> someNumbers.foreach((x: Int) => println(x))
-11
-10
-5
0
510
As another example, collection types also have a filter method. This method selects those elements of a
collection that pass a test the user supplies. That test is supplied using a function. For example, the
function (x: Int) => x > 0 could be used for filtering. This function maps positive integers to true and all
others to false. Here is how to use it with filter:
scala> someNumbers.filter((x: Int) => x > 0)
res4: List[Int] = List(5, 10)
Methods like foreach and filter are described further later in the book. Chapter 16 talks about their use
in class List. Chapter 17 discusses their use with other collection types.
8.4 SHORT FORMS OF FUNCTION LITERALS
Scala provides a number of ways to leave out redundant information and write function literals more
briefly. Keep your eyes open for these opportunities, because they allow you to remove clutter from
your code.
One way to make a function literal more brief is to leave off the parameter types. Thus, the previous
example with filter could be written like this:
scala> someNumbers.filter((x) => x > 0)
res5: List[Int] = List(5, 10)
The Scala compiler knows that x must be an integer, because it sees that you are immediately using the
function to filter a list of integers (referred to by someNumbers). This is called target typing because
the targeted usage of an expression (in this case, an argument tosomeNumbers.filter()) is allowed to
influence the typing of that expression (in this case to determine the type of the x parameter). The
precise details of target typing are not important. You can simply start by writing a function literal
without the argument type, and if the compiler gets confused, add in the type. Over time you'll get a
feel for which situations the compiler can and cannot puzzle out.
A second way to remove useless characters is to leave out parentheses around a parameter whose type
is inferred. In the previous example, the parentheses around x are unnecessary:
scala> someNumbers.filter(x => x > 0)
res6: List[Int] = List(5, 10)
8.5 PLACEHOLDER SYNTAX
To make a function literal even more concise, you can use underscores as placeholders for one or more
parameters, so long as each parameter appears only one time within the function literal. For
example, _ > 0 is very short notation for a function that checks whether a value is greater than zero:
scala> someNumbers.filter(_ > 0)
res7: List[Int] = List(5, 10)You can think of the underscore as a "blank" in the expression that needs to be "filled in." This blank
will be filled in with an argument to the function each time the function is invoked. For example, given
that someNumbers was initialized here to the valueList(-11, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10), the filter method will
replace the blank in _ > 0 first with -11, as in-11 > 0, then with -10, as in -10 > 0, then with -5, as in -
5 > 0, and so on to the end of the List. The function literal _ > 0, therefore, is equivalent to the slightly
more verbose x => x > 0, as demonstrated here:
scala> someNumbers.filter(x => x > 0)
res8: List[Int] = List(5, 10)
Sometimes when you use underscores as placeholders for parameters, the compiler might not have
enough information to infer missing parameter types. For example, suppose you write_ + _ by itself:
scala> val f = _ + _
<console>:7: error: missing parameter type for expanded
function ((x$1, x$2) => x$1.$plus(x$2))
val f = _ + _
^
In such cases, you can specify the types using a colon, like this:
scala> val f = (_: Int) + (_: Int)
f: (Int, Int) => Int = <function2>
scala> f(5, 10)
res9: Int = 15
Note that _ + _ expands into a literal for a function that takes two parameters. This is why you can use
this short form only if each parameter appears in the function literal exactly once. Multiple underscores
mean multiple parameters, not reuse of a single parameter repeatedly. The first underscore represents
the first parameter, the second underscore the second parameter, the third underscore the third
parameter, and so on.
8.6 PARTIALLY APPLIED FUNCTIONS
Although the previous examples substitute underscores in place of individual parameters, you can also
replace an entire parameter list with an underscore. For example, rather than writing println(_), you
could write println _. Here's an example:
someNumbers.foreach(println _)
Scala treats this short form exactly as if you had written the following:
someNumbers.foreach(x => println(x))
Thus, the underscore in this case is not a placeholder for a single parameter. It is a placeholder for an
entire parameter list. Remember that you need to leave a space between the function name and the
underscore; otherwise, the compiler will think you are referring to a different symbol, such as, for
example, a method named println_, which likely does not exist.When you use an underscore in this way, you are writing a partially applied function. In Scala, when
you invoke a function, passing in any needed arguments, you apply that functionto the arguments. For
example, given the following function:
scala> def sum(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int) = a + b + c
sum: (a: Int, b: Int, c: Int)Int
You could apply the function sum to the arguments 1, 2, and 3 like this:
scala> sum(1, 2, 3)
res10: Int = 6
A partially applied function is an expression in which you don't supply all of the arguments needed by
the function. Instead, you supply some, or none, of the needed arguments. For example, to create a
partially applied function expression involving sum, in which you supply none of the three required
arguments, you just place an underscore after "sum". The resulting function can then be stored in a
variable. Here's an example:
scala> val a = sum _
a: (Int, Int, Int) => Int = <function3>
Given this code, the Scala compiler instantiates a function value that takes the three integer parameters
missing from the partially applied function expression, sum _, and assigns a reference to that new
function value to the variable a. When you apply three arguments to this new function value, it will turn
around and invoke sum, passing in those same three arguments:
scala> a(1, 2, 3)
res11: Int = 6
Here's what just happened: The variable named a refers to a function value object. This function value
is an instance of a class generated automatically by the Scala compiler from sum _, the partially applied
function expression. The class generated by the compiler has an applymethod that takes three
arguments.footnote:[The generated class extends trait Function3, which declares a three-arg apply method.] The generated class's apply method takes three arguments because three is the number of
arguments missing in the sum _ expression. The Scala compiler translates the expression a(1, 2, 3) into
an invocation of the function value'sapply method, passing in the three arguments 1, 2, and 3.
Thus, a(1, 2, 3) is a short form for:
scala> a.apply(1, 2, 3)
res12: Int = 6
This apply method, defined in the class generated automatically by the Scala compiler from the
expression sum _, simply forwards those three missing parameters to sum, and returns the result. In this
case apply invokes sum(1, 2, 3), and returns what sum returns, which is 6.
Another way to think about this kind of expression, in which an underscore is used to represent an
entire parameter list, is as a way to transform a def into a function value. For example, if you have a
local function, such as sum(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int): Int, you can "wrap" it in a function value
whose apply method has the same parameter list and result types. When you apply this function valueto some arguments, it in turn applies sum to those same arguments and returns the result. Although you
can't assign a method or nested function to a variable, or pass it as an argument to another function, you
can do these things if you wrap the method or nested function in a function value by placing an
underscore after its name.
Now, although sum _ is indeed a partially applied function, it may not be obvious to you why it is
called this. It has this name because you are not applying that function to all of its arguments. In the
case of sum _, you are applying it to none of its arguments. But you can also express a partially applied
function by supplying only some of the required arguments. Here's an example:
scala> val b = sum(1, _: Int, 3)
b: Int => Int = <function1>
In this case, you've supplied the first and last argument to sum, but not the middle argument. Since only
one argument is missing, the Scala compiler generates a new function class whoseapply method takes
one argument. When invoked with that one argument, this generated function's apply method
invokes sum, passing in 1, the argument passed to the function, and 3. Here are some examples:
scala> b(2)
res13: Int = 6
In this case, b.apply invoked sum(1, 2, 3).
scala> b(5)
res14: Int = 9
And in this case, b.apply invoked sum(1, 5, 3).
If you are writing a partially applied function expression in which you leave off all parameters, such
as println _ or sum _, you can express it more concisely by leaving off the underscore if a function is
required at that point in the code. For example, instead of printing out each of the numbers
in someNumbers (defined here) like this:
someNumbers.foreach(println _)
You could just write:
someNumbers.foreach(println)
This last form is allowed only in places where a function is required, such as the invocation
offoreach in this example. The compiler knows a function is required in this case,
becauseforeach requires that a function be passed as an argument. In situations where a function is not
required, attempting to use this form will cause a compilation error. Here's an example:
scala> val c = sum
<console>:8: error: missing arguments for method sum;
follow this method with `_' if you want to treat it as a
partially applied function
val c = sum
^
scala> val d = sum _d: (Int, Int, Int) => Int = <function3>
scala> d(10, 20, 30)
res14: Int = 60
8.7 CLOSURES
So far in this chapter, all the examples of function literals have referred only to passed parameters. For
example, in (x: Int) => x > 0, the only variable used in the function body, x > 0, is x, which is defined
as a parameter to the function. You can, however, refer to variables defined elsewhere:
(x: Int) => x + more
// how much more?
This function adds "more" to its argument, but what is more? From the point of view of this
function, more is a free variable because the function literal does not itself give a meaning to it.
The x variable, by contrast, is a bound variable because it does have a meaning in the context of the
function: it is defined as the function's lone parameter, an Int. If you try using this function literal by
itself, without any more defined in its scope, the compiler will complain:
scala> (x: Int) => x + more
<console>:8: error: not found: value more
(x: Int) => x + more
^
WHY THE TRAILING UNDERSCORE?
Scala's syntax for partially applied functions highlights a difference in the design trade-offs of Scala
and classical functional languages, such as Haskell or ML. In these languages, partially applied
functions are considered the normal case. Furthermore, these languages have a fairly strict static type
system that will usually highlight every error with partial applications that you can make. Scala bears a
much closer relation to imperative languages, such as Java, where a method that's not applied to all its
arguments is considered an error. Furthermore, the object-oriented tradition of subtyping and a
universal root type accepts some programs that would be considered erroneous in classical functional
languages.
For instance, say you mistook the drop(n: Int) method of List for tail(), and therefore forgot you need to
pass a number to drop. You might write, "println(drop)". Had Scala adopted the classical functional
tradition that partially applied functions are OK everywhere, this code would type check. However, you
might be surprised to find out that the output printed by this println statement would always
be <function>! What would have happened is that the expression drop would have been treated as a
function object. Because println takes objects of any type, this would have compiled OK, but it would
have given an unexpected result.
To avoid situations like this, Scala normally requires you to specify function arguments that are left out
explicitly, even if the indication is as simple as a `_'. Scala allows you to leave off even the _ only when
a function type is expected.On the other hand, the same function literal will work fine so long as there is something available
named more:
scala> var more = 1
more: Int = 1
scala> val addMore = (x: Int) => x + more
addMore: Int => Int = <function1>
scala> addMore(10)
res16: Int = 11
The function value (the object) that's created at runtime from this function literal is called aclosure. The
name arises from the act of "closing" the function literal by "capturing" the bindings of its free
variables. A function literal with no free variables, such as (x: Int) => x + 1, is called a closed term,
where a term is a bit of source code. Thus a function value created at runtime from this function literal
is not a closure in the strictest sense, because (x: Int) => x + 1is already closed as written. But any
function literal with free variables, such as(x: Int) => x + more, is an open term. Therefore, any
function value created at runtime from(x: Int) => x + more will, by definition, require that a binding for
its free variable, more, be captured. The resulting function value, which will contain a reference to the
captured morevariable, is called a closure because the function value is the end product of the act of
closing the open term, (x: Int) => x + more.
This example brings up a question: What happens if more changes after the closure is created? In Scala,
the answer is that the closure sees the change. For example:
scala> more = 9999
more: Int = 9999
scala> addMore(10)
res17: Int = 10009
Intuitively, Scala's closures capture variables themselves, not the value to which variables refer.footnote:[By contrast, Java's inner classes do not allow you to access modifiable variables in surrounding scopes at all, so there is no difference between capturing a variable and capturing its currently held value.] As
the previous example shows, the closure created for (x: Int) => x + more sees the change to more made
outside the closure. The same is true in the opposite direction. Changes made by a closure to a captured
variable are visible outside the closure. Here's an example:
scala> val someNumbers = List(-11, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10)
someNumbers: List[Int] = List(-11, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10)
scala> var sum = 0
sum: Int = 0
scala> someNumbers.foreach(sum +=
scala> sum
res19: Int = -11
_)This example uses a roundabout way to sum the numbers in a List. Variable sum is in a surrounding
scope from the function literal sum += _, which adds numbers to sum. Even though it is the closure
modifying sum at runtime, the resulting total, -11, is still visible outside the closure.
What if a closure accesses some variable that has several different copies as the program runs? For
example, what if a closure uses a local variable of some function, and the function is invoked many
times? Which instance of that variable gets used at each access?
Only one answer is consistent with the rest of the language: the instance used is the one that was active
at the time the closure was created. For example, here is a function that creates and returns "increase"
closures:
def makeIncreaser(more: Int) = (x: Int) => x + more
Each time this function is called it will create a new closure. Each closure will access the morevariable
that was active when the closure was created.
scala> val inc1 = makeIncreaser(1)
inc1: Int => Int = <function1>
scala> val inc9999 = makeIncreaser(9999)
inc9999: Int => Int = <function1>
When you call makeIncreaser(1), a closure is created and returned that captures the value 1 as the
binding for more. Similarly, when you call makeIncreaser(9999), a closure that captures the
value 9999 for more is returned. When you apply these closures to arguments (in this case, there's just
one argument, x, which must be passed in), the result that comes back depends on how more was
defined when the closure was created:
scala> inc1(10)
res20: Int = 11
scala> inc9999(10)
res21: Int = 10009
It makes no difference that the more in this case is a parameter to a method call that has already
returned. The Scala compiler rearranges things in cases like these so that the captured parameter lives
out on the heap, instead of the stack, and thus can outlive themethod call that created it. This
rearrangement is all taken care of automatically, so you don't have to worry about it. Capture any
variable you like: val, var, or parameter.
8.8 SPECIAL FUNCTION CALL FORMS
Most functions and function calls you encounter will be as you have seen so far in this chapter. The
function will have a fixed number of parameters, the call will have an equal number of arguments, and
the arguments will be specified in the same order and number as the parameters.Since function calls are so central to programming in Scala, however, a few special forms of function
definitions and function calls have been added to the language to address some special needs. Scala
supports repeated parameters, named arguments, and default arguments.
Repeated parameters
Scala allows you to indicate that the last parameter to a function may be repeated. This allows clients to
pass variable length argument lists to the function. To denote a repeated parameter, place an asterisk
after the type of the parameter. For example:
scala> def echo(args: String*) =
for (arg <- args) println(arg)
echo: (args: String*)Unit
Defined this way, echo can be called with zero to many String arguments:
scala> echo()
scala> echo("one")
one
scala> echo("hello", "world!")
hello
world!
Inside the function, the type of the repeated parameter is an Array of the declared type of the parameter.
Thus, the type of args inside the echo function, which is declared as type "String*" is
actually Array[String]. Nevertheless, if you have an array of the appropriate type, and you attempt to
pass it as a repeated parameter, you'll get a compiler error:
scala> val arr = Array("What's", "up", "doc?")
arr: Array[String] = Array(What's, up, doc?)
scala> echo(arr)
<console>:10: error: type mismatch;
found
: Array[String]
required: String
echo(arr)
^
To accomplish this, you'll need to append the array argument with a colon and an _* symbol,like this:
scala> echo(arr: _*)
What's
up
doc?
This notation tells the compiler to pass each element of arr as its own argument to echo, rather than all
of it as a single argument.Named arguments
In a normal function call, the arguments in the call are matched one by one in the order of the
parameters of the called function:
scala> def speed(distance: Float, time: Float): Float =
distance / time
speed: (distance: Float, time: Float)Float
scala> speed(100, 10)
res27: Float = 10.0
In this call, the 100 is matched to distance and the 10 to time. The 100 and 10 are matched in the same
order as the formal parameters are listed.
Named arguments allow you to pass arguments to a function in a different order. The syntax is simply
that each argument is preceded by a parameter name and an equals sign. For example, the following
call to speed is equivalent to speed(100,10):
scala> speed(distance = 100, time = 10)
res28: Float = 10.0
Called with named arguments, the arguments can be reversed without changing the meaning:
scala> speed(time = 10, distance = 100)
res29: Float = 10.0
It is also possible to mix positional and named arguments. In that case, the positional arguments come
first. Named arguments are most frequently used in combination with default parameter values.
Default parameter values
Scala lets you specify default values for function parameters. The argument for such a parameter can
optionally be omitted from a function call, in which case the corresponding argument will be filled in
with the default.
An example is shown in Listing 8.3. Function printTime has one parameter, out, and it has a default
value of Console.out.
def printTime(out: java.io.PrintStream = Console.out) =
out.println("time = " + System.currentTimeMillis())
Listing 8.3 - A parameter with a default value.
If you call the function as printTime(), thus specifying no argument to be used for out, then outwill be
set to its default value of Console.out. You could also call the function with an explicit output stream.
For example, you could send logging to the standard error output by calling the function
as printTime(Console.err).
Default parameters are especially helpful when used in combination with named parameters. In Listing
8.4, function printTime2 has two optional parameters. The out parameter has a default of Console.out,
and the divisor parameter has a default value of 1.def printTime2(out: java.io.PrintStream = Console.out,
divisor: Int = 1) =
out.println("time = " + System.currentTimeMillis()/divisor)
Listing 8.4 - A function with two parameters that have defaults.
Function printTime2 can be called as printTime2() to have both parameters filled in with their default
values. Using named arguments, however, either one of the parameters can be specified while leaving
the other as the default. To specify the output stream, call it like this:
printTime2(out = Console.err)
To specify the time divisor, call it like this:
printTime2(divisor = 1000)
8.9 TAIL RECURSION
In Section 7.2, we mentioned that to transform a while loop that updates vars into a more functional
style that uses only vals, you may sometimes need to use recursion. Here's an example of a recursive
function that approximates a value by repeatedly improving a guess until it is good enough:
def approximate(guess: Double): Double =
if (isGoodEnough(guess)) guess
else approximate(improve(guess))
A function like this is often used in search problems, with appropriate implementations
forisGoodEnough and improve. If you want the approximate function to run faster, you might be
tempted to write it with a while loop to try and speed it up, like this:
def approximateLoop(initialGuess: Double): Double = {
var guess = initialGuess
while (!isGoodEnough(guess))
guess = improve(guess)
guess
}
Which of the two versions of approximate is preferable? In terms of brevity and var avoidance, the
first, functional one wins. But is the imperative approach perhaps more efficient? In fact, if we measure
execution times, it turns out that they are almost exactly the same!
This might seem surprising because a recursive call looks much more "expansive" than a simple jump
from the end of a loop to its beginning. However, in the case of approximate above, the Scala compiler
is able to apply an important optimization. Note that the recursive call is the last thing that happens in
the evaluation of function approximate's body. Functions likeapproximate, which call themselves as
their last action, are called tail recursive. The Scala compiler detects tail recursion and replaces it with
a jump back to the beginning of the function, after updating the function parameters with the new
values.The moral is that you should not shy away from using recursive algorithms to solve your problem.
Often, a recursive solution is more elegant and concise than a loop-based one. If the solution is tail
recursive, there won't be any runtime overhead to be paid.
Tracing tail-recursive functions
A tail-recursive function will not build a new stack frame for each call; all calls will execute in a single
frame. This may surprise a programmer inspecting a stack trace of a program that failed. For example,
this function calls itself some number of times then throws an exception:
def boom(x: Int): Int =
if (x == 0) throw new Exception("boom!")
else boom(x - 1) + 1
This function is not tail recursive, because it performs an increment operation after the recursive call.
You'll get what you expect when you run it:
scala> boom(3)
java.lang.Exception: boom!
at .boom(<console>:5)
at .boom(<console>:6)
at .boom(<console>:6)
at .boom(<console>:6)
at .<init>(<console>:6)
...
TAIL CALL OPTIMIZATION
The compiled code for approximate is essentially the same as the compiled code forapproximateLoop.
Both functions compile down to the same thirteen instructions of Java bytecodes. If you look through
the bytecodes generated by the Scala compiler for the tail recursive method, approximate, you'll see
that although both isGoodEnough and improveare invoked in the body of the method, approximate is
not. The Scala compiler optimized away the recursive call:
public double approximate(double);
Code:
0:
aload_0
1:
astore_3
2:
aload_0
3:
dload_1
4:
invokevirtual
#24; //Method isGoodEnough:(D)Z
7:
ifeq
12
10: dload_1
11: dreturn
12: aload_0
13: dload_1
14: invokevirtual
#27; //Method improve:(D)D
17: dstore_1
18: goto
2
If you now modify boom so that it does become tail recursive:
def bang(x: Int): Int =if (x == 0) throw new Exception("bang!")
else bang(x - 1)
You'll get:
scala> bang(5)
java.lang.Exception: bang!
at .bang(<console>:5)
at .<init>(<console>:6) ...
This time, you see only a single stack frame for bang. You might think that bang crashed before it
called itself, but this is not the case. If you think you might be confused by tail-call optimizations when
looking at a stack trace, you can turn them off by giving the following argument to the scala shell or to
the scalac compiler:
-g:notailcalls
With that option specified, you will get a longer stack trace:
scala> bang(5)
java.lang.Exception: bang!
at .bang(<console>:5)
at .bang(<console>:5)
at .bang(<console>:5)
at .bang(<console>:5)
at .bang(<console>:5)
at .bang(<console>:5)
at .<init>(<console>:6) ...
Limits of tail recursion
The use of tail recursion in Scala is fairly limited because the JVM instruction set makes implementing
more advanced forms of tail recursion very difficult. Scala only optimizes directly recursive calls back
to the same function making the call. If the recursion is indirect, as in the following example of two
mutually recursive functions, no optimization is possible:
def isEven(x: Int): Boolean =
if (x == 0) true else isOdd(x - 1)
def isOdd(x: Int): Boolean =
if (x == 0) false else isEven(x - 1)
You also won't get a tail-call optimization if the final call goes to a function value. Consider for
instance the following recursive code:
val funValue = nestedFun _
def nestedFun(x: Int) : Unit = {
if (x != 0) { println(x); funValue(x - 1) }
}
The funValue variable refers to a function value that essentially wraps a call to nestedFun. When you
apply the function value to an argument, it turns around and applies nestedFun to that same argument,
and returns the result. Therefore, you might hope the Scala compiler would perform a tail-calloptimization, but in this case it would not. Tail-call optimization is limited to situations where a method
or nested function calls itself directly as its last operation, without going through a function value or
some other intermediary. (If you don't fully understand tail recursion yet, see Section 8.9).
8.10 CONCLUSION
This chapter has given you a grand tour of functions in Scala. In addition to methods, Scala provides
local functions, function literals, and function values. In addition to normal function calls, Scala
provides partially applied functions and functions with repeated parameters. When possible, function
calls are implemented as optimized tail calls, and thus many nice-looking recursive functions run just
as quickly as hand-optimized versions that use whileloops. The next chapter will build on these
foundations and show how Scala's rich support for functions helps you abstract over control.
