<div class="paragraph"><p>This chapter describes the architecture of the Scala collections framework in detail. Continuing the
theme of Chapter 24, you will find out more about the internal workings of the framework. You will
also learn how this architecture helps you define your own collections in a few lines of code, while
reusing the overwhelming part of collection functionality from the framework.
Chapter 24 enumerated a large number of collection operations, which exist uniformly on many
different collection implementations. Implementing every collection operation anew for every
collection type would lead to an enormous amount of code, most of which would be copied from
somewhere else. Such code duplication could lead to inconsistencies over time, when an operation is
added or modified in one part of the collection library but not in others. The principal design objective
of the new collections framework was to avoid any duplication, defining every operation in as few
places as possible.<span class="footnote"><br />[Ideally, everything should be defined in one place only, but there are a few exceptions where things needed to be redefined.]<br /></span> The design approach was to implement most operations in collection "templates"
that can be flexibly inherited from individual base classes and implementations. In this chapter, we will
examine these templates, and other classes and traits that constitute the "building blocks" of the
framework, as well as the construction principles they support.
25.1 BUILDERS
Almost all collection operations are implemented in terms of traversals and builders. Traversals are
handled by Traversable&#8217;s foreach method, and building new collections is handled by instances of
class Builder. Listing 25.1 presents a slightly abbreviated outline of this class.
package scala.collection.generic
class
def
def
def
def
=
}
Builder[-Elem, <code>To] {
+=(elem: Elem): this.type
result(): To
clear()
mapResult[NewTo](f: To &#8658; NewTo): Builder[Elem, NewTo]
&#8230;
Listing 25.1 - An outline of the Builder class.
You can add an element x to a builder b with b += x. There&#8217;s also syntax to add more than one element
at once: For instance, b += (x, y) and b <code>= xs work as for buffers. (In fact, buffers are an enriched
version of builders.) The result() method returns a collection from a builder. The state of the builder is
undefined after taking its result, but it can be reset into a new empty state using clear(). Builders are
generic in both the element type, Elem, and in the type, To, of collections they return.
Often, a builder can refer to some other builder for assembling the elements of a collection, but then
would like to transform the result of the other builder—for example, to give it a different type. This
task is simplified by method mapResult in class Builder. Suppose for instance you have an arraybuffer buf. Array buffers are builders for themselves, so taking theresult() of an array buffer will return
the same buffer. If you want to use this buffer to produce a builder that builds arrays, you can
use mapResult:
scala&gt; val buf = new ArrayBuffer[Int]
buf: scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int] = ArrayBuffer()
scala&gt; val bldr = buf mapResult (<em>.toArray)
bldr: scala.collection.mutable.Builder[Int,Array[Int]]
= ArrayBuffer()
The result value, bldr, is a builder that uses the array buffer, buf, to collect elements. When a result is
demanded from bldr, the result of buf is computed, which yields the array buffer bufitself. This array
buffer is then mapped with _.toArray to an array. So the end result is that bldris a builder for arrays.
25.2 FACTORING OUT COMMON OPERATIONS
The main design objectives of the collection library redesign were to have, at the same time, natural
types and maximal sharing of implementation code. In particular, Scala&#8217;s collections follow the "same-
result-type" principle: Wherever possible, a transformation method on a collection will yield a
collection of the same type. For instance, the filter operation should yield, on every collection type, an
instance of the same collection type. Applying filter on aList should give a List; applying it on
a Map should give a Map; and so on. In the rest of this section, you will find out how this is achieved.
THE FAST TRACK
The material in this section is a bit more dense than usual and might require some time to absorb. If
you want to move ahead quickly, you could skip the remainder of this section and move on to Section
25.3 here where you will learn from concrete examples how to integrate your own collection classes in
the framework.
The Scala collection library avoids code duplication and achieves the "same-result-type" principle by
using generic builders and traversals over collections in so-calledimplementation traits. These traits are
named with a Like suffix; for instance, IndexedSeqLike is the implementation trait for IndexedSeq, and
similarly, TraversableLike is the implementation trait for Traversable. Collection classes such
as Traversable or IndexedSeq inherit all their concrete method implementations from these traits.
Implementation traits have two type parameters instead of one for normal collections. They
parameterize not only over the collection&#8217;s element type, but also over the collection&#8217;s representation
type (i.e., the type of the underlying collection), such as Seq[I] or List[T].
For instance, here is the header of trait TraversableLike:
trait TraversableLike[+Elem, +Repr] { &#8230; }
The type parameter, Elem, stands for the element type of the traversable whereas the type
parameter Repr stands for its representation. There are no constraints on Repr. In particularRepr might
be instantiated to a type that is itself not a subtype of Traversable. That way, classes outside thecollections hierarchy, such as String and Array, can still make use of all operations defined in a
collection implementation trait.
package scala.collection
trait TraversableLike[+Elem, +Repr] {
def newBuilder: Builder[Elem, Repr] // deferred
def foreach[U](f: Elem &#8658; U)

&#8230;
def filter(p: Elem &#8658; Boolean): Repr = {
val b = newBuilder
foreach { elem &#8658; if (p(elem)) b += elem }
b.result
}
}
Listing 25.2 - Implementation of filter in TraversableLike.
Taking filter as an example, this operation is defined once for all collection classes in the
trait TraversableLike. An outline of the relevant code is shown in Listing 25.2. The trait declares two
abstract methods, newBuilder and foreach, which are implemented in concrete collection classes.
The filter operation is implemented in the same way for all collections using these methods. It first
constructs a new builder for the representation type Repr, using newBuilder. It then traverses all
elements of the current collection, using foreach. If an element x satisfies the given predicate p—
i.e., p(x) is true—it is added with the builder. Finally, the elements collected in the builder are returned
as an instance of the Repr collection type by calling the builder&#8217;sresult method.
The map operation on collections is a bit more complicated. For instance, if f is a function
fromString to Int, and xs is a List[String], then xs map f should give a List[Int]. Likewise, if ys is
anArray[String], then ys map f should give a Array[Int]. But how do you achieve that without
duplicating the definition of the map method in lists and arrays?
The newBuilder/foreach framework shown in Listing 25.2 is not sufficient for this because it only
allows creation of new instances of the same collection type, whereas map needs an instance of the
same collection type constructor but possibly with a different element type. What&#8217;s more, even the
result type constructor of a function like map might depend, in non-trivial ways, on the other argument
types. Here is an example:
scala&gt; import collection.immutable.BitSet
import collection.immutable.BitSet
scala&gt; val bits = BitSet(1, 2, 3)
bits: scala.collection.immutable.BitSet = BitSet(1, 2, 3)
scala&gt; bits map (</em> * 2)
res13: scala.collection.immutable.BitSet = BitSet(2, 4, 6)
scala&gt; bits map (<em>.toFloat)
res14: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Float] =
Set(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)If you map the doubling function _ * 2 over a bit set you obtain another bit set. However, if you map
the function (</em>.toFloat) over the same bit set, the result is a general Set[Float]. Of course, it can&#8217;t be a
bit set because bit sets contain Ints, not Floats.
Note that map&#8217;s result type depends on the type of function that&#8217;s passed to it. If the result type of that
function argument is again an Int, the result of map is a BitSet. But if the result type of the function
argument is something else, the result of map is just a Set. You&#8217;ll find out soon how this type-flexibility
is achieved in Scala.
The problem with BitSet is not an isolated case. Here are two more interactions with the interpreter that
both map a function over a map:
scala&gt; Map("a" &#8594; 1, "b" &#8594; 2) map { case (x, y) &#8658; (y, x) }
res3: scala.collection.immutable.Map[Int,java.lang.String] =
Map(1 &#8594; a, 2 &#8594; b)
scala&gt; Map("a" &#8594; 1, "b" &#8594; 2) map { case (x, y) &#8658; y }
res4: scala.collection.immutable.Iterable[Int] =
List(1, 2)
The first function swaps two arguments of a key/value pair. The result of mapping this function is again
a map, but now going in the other direction. In fact, the first expression yields the inverse of the
original map, provided it is invertible. The second function, however, maps the key/value pair to an
integer, namely its value component. In that case, we cannot form a Map from the results, but we still
can form an Iterable, a supertrait of Map.
You might ask, Why not restrict map so that it can always return the same kind of collection? For
instance, on bit sets map could accept only Int-to-Int functions and on maps it could only accept pair-
to-pair functions. Not only are such restrictions undesirable from an object-oriented modeling point of
view, they are illegal because they would violate the Liskov Substitution Principle:
A Map is an Iterable. So every operation that&#8217;s legal on an Iterable must also be legal on a Map.
Scala solves this problem instead with overloading: Not the simple form of overloading inherited by
Java (that would not be flexible enough), but the more systematic form of overloading that&#8217;s provided
by implicit parameters.
def map[B, That](f: Elem &#8658; B)
(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That = {
val b = bf(this)
for (x &#8592; this) b += f(x)
b.result
}
Listing 25.3 - Implementation of map in TraversableLike.
Listing 25.3 shows trait TraversableLike&#8217;s implementation of map. It&#8217;s quite similar to the
implementation of filter shown in Listing 25.2. The principal difference is that where filterused
the newBuilder method, which is abstract in class TraversableLike, map uses a builder factorythat&#8217;s
passed as an additional implicit parameter of type CanBuildFrom.package scala.collection.generic
trait CanBuildFrom[-From, -Elem, +To] {

def apply(from: From): Builder[Elem, To]
}
Listing 25.4 - The CanBuildFrom trait.
Listing 25.4 shows the definition of the trait CanBuildFrom, which represents builder factories. It has
three type parameters: Elem indicates the element type of the collection to be built, Toindicates the type
of collection to build, and From indicates the type for which this builder factory applies. By defining
the right implicit definitions of builder factories, you can tailor the right typing behavior as needed.
Take class BitSet as an example. Its companion object would contain a builder factory of
typeCanBuildFrom[BitSet, Int, BitSet]. This means that when operating on a BitSet you can construct
another BitSet, provided the type of the collection to build is Int. If this is not the case, you can always
fall back to a different implicit builder factory, this time implemented inmutable.Set&#8217;s companion
object. The type of this more general builder factory, where A is a generic type parameter, is:
CanBuildFrom[Set[<em>], A, Set[A]]
This means that when operating on an arbitrary Set, expressed by the wildcard type Set[</em>], you can
build a Set again no matter what the element type A is. Given these two implicit instances
of CanBuildFrom, you can then rely on Scala&#8217;s rules for implicit resolution to pick the one that&#8217;s
appropriate and maximally specific.
So implicit resolution provides the correct static types for tricky collection operations, such asmap. But
what about the dynamic types? Specifically, say you have a list value that has Iterableas its static type,
and you map some function over that value:
scala&gt; val xs: Iterable[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)
xs: Iterable[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)
scala&gt; val ys = xs map (x &#8658; x * x)
ys: Iterable[Int] = List(1, 4, 9)
The static type of ys above is Iterable, as expected. But its dynamic type is (and should be) stillList!
This behavior is achieved by one more indirection. The apply method in CanBuildFrom is passed the
source collection as argument. Most builder factories for generic traversables (in fact all except builder
factories for leaf classes) forward the call to a method genericBuilder of a collection.
The genericBuilder method in turn calls the builder that belongs to the collection in which it is defined.
So Scala uses static implicit resolution to resolve constraints on the types of map, and virtual dispatch
to pick the best dynamic type that corresponds to these constraints.
25.3 INTEGRATING NEW COLLECTIONS
What needs to be done if you want to integrate a new collection class, so that it can profit from all
predefined operations at the right types? In this section we&#8217;ll show you two examples that do this.Integrating sequences
Say you want to create a new sequence type for RNA strands, which are sequences of bases A
(adenine), T (thymine), G (guanine), and U (uracil). The definitions for bases are easily set up as shown
in Listing 25.5.
Every base is defined as a case object that inherits from a common abstract class Base. TheBase class
has a companion object that defines two functions that map between bases and the integers 0 to 3. You
can see in the examples two different ways to use collections to implement these functions.
The toInt function is implemented as a Map from Base values to integers. The reverse
function, fromInt, is implemented as an array. This makes use of the fact that both maps and
arrays are functions because they inherit from the Function1 trait.
The next task is to define a class for strands of RNA. Conceptually, a strand of RNA is simply
a Seq[Base]. However, RNA strands can get quite long, so it makes sense to invest some work in a
compact representation. Because there are only four bases, a base can be identified with two bits, and
you can therefore store sixteen bases as two-bit values in an integer. The idea, then, is to construct a
specialized subclass of Seq[Base], which uses this packed representation.
Listing 25.6 presents the first version of this class; it will be refined later. The class RNA1 has a
constructor that takes an array of Ints as its first argument. This array contains the packed RNA data,
with sixteen bases in each element, except for the last array element, which might be partially filled.
The second argument, length, specifies the total number of bases on the array (and in the sequence).
Class RNA1 extends IndexedSeq[Base]. Trait IndexedSeq, which comes from
package scala.collection.immutable, defines two abstract methods, length and apply.
abstract class Base
case object A extends
case object T extends
case object G extends
case object U extends
Base
Base
Base
Base
object Base {
val fromInt: Int &#8658; Base = Array(A, T, G, U)
val toInt: Base &#8658; Int = Map(A &#8594; 0, T &#8594; 1, G &#8594; 2, U &#8594; 3)
}
Listing 25.5 - RNA Bases.
These need to be implemented in concrete subclasses. Class RNA1 implements lengthautomatically by
defining a parametric field (described in Section 10.6) of the same name. It implements the indexing
method apply with the code given in Listing 25.6. Essentially, applyfirst extracts an integer value from
the groups array, then extracts the correct two-bit number from that integer using right shift (&gt;&gt;) and
mask (&amp;). The private constants S, N, and M come from the RNA1 companion object. S specifies the
size of each packet (i.e., two); N specifies the number of two-bit packets per integer; and M is a bit
mask that isolates the lowest S bits in a word.Note that the constructor of class RNA1 is private. This means that clients cannot
create RNA1sequences by calling new, which makes sense, because it hides the representation
of RNA1sequences in terms of packed arrays from the user. If clients cannot see what the
representation details of RNA sequences are, it becomes possible to change these representation details
at any point in the future without affecting client code.
In other words, this design achieves a good decoupling of the interface of RNA sequences and its
implementation. However, if constructing an RNA sequence with new is impossible, there must be
some other way to create new RNA sequences, or else the whole class would be rather useless. There
are two alternatives for RNA sequence creation, both provided by theRNA1 companion object. The
first way is method fromSeq, which converts a given sequence of bases (i.e., a value of type Seq[Base])
into an instance of class RNA1. The fromSeq method does this by packing all the bases contained in its
argument sequence into an array, then callingRNA1&#8217;s private constructor with that array and the length
of the original sequence as arguments. This makes use of the fact that a private constructor of a class is
visible in the class&#8217;s companion object.
import collection.IndexedSeqLike
import collection.mutable.{Builder, ArrayBuffer}
import collection.generic.CanBuildFrom
final class RNA1 private (val groups: Array[Int],
val length: Int) extends IndexedSeq[Base] {
import RNA1._
def apply(idx: Int): Base = {
if (idx &lt; 0 || length &#8656; idx)
throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException
Base.fromInt(groups(idx / N) &gt;&gt; (idx % N * S) &amp; M)
}
}
object RNA1 {

private val S = 2

private val N = 32 / S

private val M = (1 &lt;&lt; S) - 1
def fromSeq(buf: Seq[Base]): RNA1 = {
val groups = new Array[Int]((buf.length + N - 1) / N)
for (i &#8592; 0 until buf.length)
groups(i / N) |= Base.toInt(buf(i)) &lt;&lt; (i % N * S)
new RNA1(groups, buf.length)
}
}
def apply(bases: Base*) = fromSeq(bases)Listing 25.6 - RNA strands class, first version.
The second way to create an RNA1 value is provided by the apply method in the RNA1 object. It takes
a variable number of Base arguments and simply forwards them as a sequence to fromSeq.
Here are the two creation schemes in action:
scala&gt; val xs = List(A, G, T, A)
xs: List[Product with Base] = List(A, G, T, A)
scala&gt; RNA1.fromSeq(xs)
res1: RNA1 = RNA1(A, G, T, A)
scala&gt; val rna1 = RNA1(A, U, G, G, T)
rna1: RNA1 = RNA1(A, U, G, G, T)
Adapting the result type of RNA methods
Here are some more interactions with the RNA1 abstraction:
scala&gt; rna1.length
res2: Int = 5
scala&gt; rna1.last
res3: Base = T
scala&gt; rna1.take(3)
res4: IndexedSeq[Base] = Vector(A, U, G)
The first two results are as expected, but the last result of taking the first three elements ofrna1 might
not be. In fact, you see an IndexedSeq[Base] as static result type and a Vector as the dynamic type of
the result value. You might have expected to see an RNA1 value instead. But this is not possible
because all that was done in Listing 25.6 was make RNA1 extend IndexedSeq. Class IndexedSeq, on
the other hand, has a take method that returns an IndexedSeq, and that&#8217;s implemented in terms
of IndexedSeq&#8217;s default implementation, Vector.
Now that you understand why things are the way they are, the next question should be what needs to be
done to change them? One way to do this would be to override the take method in class RNA1, maybe
like this:
def take(count: Int): RNA1 = RNA1.fromSeq(super.take(count))
This would do the job for take. But what about drop, or filter, or init? In fact there are over fifty
methods on sequences that return again a sequence. For consistency, all of these would have to be
overridden. This looks less and less like an attractive option.
Fortunately, there is a much easier way to achieve the same effect. The RNA class needs to inherit not
only from IndexedSeq, but also from its implementation trait IndexedSeqLike. This is shown in Listing
25.7. The new implementation differs from the previous one in only two aspects. First,
class RNA2 now also extends from IndexedSeqLike[Base, RNA2]. The IndexedSeqLiketrait
implements all concrete methods of IndexedSeq in an extensible way.For instance, the return type of methods like take, drop, filter or init is the second type parameter
passed to class IndexedSeqLike (i.e., RNA2 in Listing 25.7). To do this, IndexedSeqLikebases itself on
the newBuilder abstraction, which creates a builder of the right kind. Subclasses of
trait IndexedSeqLike have to override newBuilder to return collections of their own kind. In
class RNA2, the newBuilder method returns a builder of type Builder[Base, RNA2]. To construct this
builder, it first creates an ArrayBuffer, which itself is a Builder[Base, ArrayBuffer]. It then transforms
the ArrayBuffer builder by calling its mapResult method to an RNA2 builder. ThemapResult method
expects a transformation function from ArrayBuffer to RNA2 as its parameter. The function given is
simply RNA2.fromSeq, which converts an arbitrary base sequence to an RNA2value (recall that an
array buffer is a kind of sequence, so RNA2.fromSeq can be applied to it).
final class RNA2 private (
val groups: Array[Int],
val length: Int
) extends IndexedSeq[Base] with IndexedSeqLike[Base, RNA2] {
import RNA2._
override def newBuilder: Builder[Base, RNA2] =
new ArrayBuffer[Base] mapResult fromSeq
}
def apply(idx: Int): Base = // as before
Listing 25.7 - RNA strands class, second version.
If you had left out the newBuilder definition, you would have gotten an error message like the
following:
RNA2.scala:5: error: overriding method newBuilder in trait
TraversableLike of type &#8658; scala.collection.mutable.Builder[Base,RNA2];
method newBuilder in trait GenericTraversableTemplate of type
&#8658; scala.collection.mutable.Builder[Base,IndexedSeq[Base]] has
incompatible type
class RNA2 private (val groups: Array[Int], val length: Int)
^
one error found
The error message is quite long and complicated, which reflects the intricate way the collection
libraries are put together. It&#8217;s best to ignore the information about where the methods come from,
because in this case it detracts more than it helps. What remains is that a method newBuilder with result
type Builder[Base, RNA2] needed to be defined, but a methodnewBuilder with result
type Builder[Base,IndexedSeq[Base]] was found. The latter does not override the former.
The first method, whose result type is Builder[Base, RNA2], is an abstract method that got instantiated
at this type in Listing 25.7 by passing the RNA2 type parameter to IndexedSeqLike. The second
method, of result type Builder[Base,IndexedSeq[Base]], is what&#8217;s provided by the
inherited IndexedSeq class. In other words, the RNA2 class is invalid without a definition
ofnewBuilder with the first result type.With the refined implementation of the RNA class in Listing 25.7, methods like take, drop,
orfilter work now as expected:
scala&gt; val rna2 = RNA2(A, U, G, G, T)
rna2: RNA2 = RNA2(A, U, G, G, T)
scala&gt; rna2 take 3
res5: RNA2 = RNA2(A, U, G)
scala&gt; rna2 filter (U !=)
res6: RNA2 = RNA2(A, G, G, T)
Dealing with map and friends
There is another class of methods in collections that we haven&#8217;t dealt with yet. These methods do not
always return the collection type exactly. They might return the same kind of collection, but with a
different element type. The classical example of this is the map method. Ifs is a Seq[Int], and f is a
function from Int to String, then s.map(f) would return a Seq[String]. So the element type changes
between the receiver and the result, but the kind of collection stays the same.
There are a number of other methods that behave like map. For some of them you would expect this
(e.g., flatMap, collect), but for others you might not. For instance, the append method, </code>, also might
return a result whose type differs from that of its arguments—appending a list of String to a list
of Int would give a list of Any. How should these methods be adapted to RNA strands? Ideally we&#8217;d
expect that mapping bases to bases over an RNA strand would yield again an RNA strand:
scala&gt; val rna = RNA(A, U, G, G, T)
rna: RNA = RNA(A, U, G, G, T)
scala&gt; rna map { case A &#8658; T case b &#8658; b }
res7: RNA = RNA(T, U, G, G, T)
Likewise, appending two RNA strands with <code> should yield again another RNA strand:
scala&gt; rna </code> rna
res8: RNA = RNA(A, U, G, G, T, A, U, G, G, T)
On the other hand, mapping bases to some other type over an RNA strand cannot yield another RNA
strand because the new elements have the wrong type. It has to yield a sequence instead. In the same
vein appending elements that are not of type Base to an RNA strand can yield a general sequence, but it
cannot yield another RNA strand.
scala&gt; rna map Base.toInt
res2: IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(0, 3, 2, 2, 1)
scala&gt; rna <code> List("missing", "data")
res3: IndexedSeq[java.lang.Object] =
Vector(A, U, G, G, T, missing, data)This is what you&#8217;d expect in the ideal case. But this is not what the RNA2 class as given inListing
25.7 provides. In fact, if you ran the first two examples above with instances of this class you would
obtain:
scala&gt; val rna2 = RNA2(A, U, G, G, T)
rna2: RNA2 = RNA2(A, U, G, G, T)
scala&gt; rna2 map { case A &#8658; T case b &#8658; b }
res0: IndexedSeq[Base] = Vector(T, U, G, G, T)
scala&gt; rna2 </code> rna2
res1: IndexedSeq[Base] = Vector(A, U, G, G, T, A, U, G, G, T)
So the result of map and <code> is never an RNA strand, even if the element type of the generated
collection is a Base. To see how to do better, it pays to have a close look at the signature of
themap method (or of </code>, which has a similar signature). The map method is originally defined in
class scala.collection.TraversableLike with the following signature:
def map[B, That](f: Elem &#8658; B)
(implicit cbf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That
Here Elem is the type of elements of the collection, and Repr is the type of the collection itself; that is,
the second type parameter that gets passed to implementation classes such
asTraversableLike and IndexedSeqLike. The map method takes two more type parameters, B and That.
The B parameter stands for the result type of the mapping function, which is also the element type of
the new collection. The That appears as the result type of map, so it represents the type of the new
collection that gets created.
How is the That type determined? It is linked to the other types by an implicit parameter cbf, of
type CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]. These CanBuildFrom implicits are defined by the individual
collection classes. In essence, an implicit value of type CanBuildFrom[From, Elem, To] says: "Here is
a way, given a collection of type From, to build with elements of type Elem a collection of typeTo."
final class RNA private (val groups: Array[Int], val length: Int)
extends IndexedSeq[Base] with IndexedSeqLike[Base, RNA] {
import RNA._

override protected[this] def newBuilder: Builder[Base, RNA] =
RNA.newBuilder

def apply(idx: Int): Base = {
if (idx &lt; 0 || length &#8656; idx)
throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException
Base.fromInt(groups(idx / N) &gt;&gt; (idx % N * S) &amp; M)
}


override def foreach[U](f: Base &#8658; U): Unit = {
var i = 0var b = 0
while (i &lt; length) {
b = if (i % N == 0) groups(i / N) else b &gt;&gt;&gt; S
f(Base.fromInt(b &amp; M))
i += 1
}
}
}
Listing 25.8 - RNA strands class, final version.
Now the behavior of map and <code> on RNA2 sequences becomes clearer. There is
no CanBuildFrominstance that creates RNA2 sequences, so the next best available CanBuildFrom was
found in the companion object of the inherited trait IndexedSeq. That implicit creates IndexedSeqs, and
that&#8217;s what you saw when applying map to rna2.
To address this shortcoming, you need to define an implicit instance of CanBuildFrom in the
companion object of the RNA class. That instance should have typeCanBuildFrom[RNA, Base, RNA].
Hence, this instance states that, given an RNA strand and a new element type Base, you can build
another collection which is again an RNA strand. Listing 25.8 and Listing 25.9 show the details.
object RNA {
private val S = 2

private val M = (1 &lt;&lt; S) - 1 // bitmask to isolate a group
private val N = 32 / S

def fromSeq(buf: Seq[Base]): RNA = {
val groups = new Array[Int]((buf.length + N - 1) / N)
for (i &#8592; 0 until buf.length)
groups(i / N) |= Base.toInt(buf(i)) &lt;&lt; (i % N * S)
new RNA(groups, buf.length)
}
def apply(bases: Base*) = fromSeq(bases)
def newBuilder: Builder[Base, RNA] =
new ArrayBuffer mapResult fromSeq
}
implicit def canBuildFrom: CanBuildFrom[RNA, Base, RNA] =
new CanBuildFrom[RNA, Base, RNA] {
def apply(): Builder[Base, RNA] = newBuilder
def apply(from: RNA): Builder[Base, RNA] = newBuilder
}
Listing 25.9 - RNA companion object—final version.
Compared to class RNA2 there are two important differences. First, the newBuilderimplementation has
moved from the RNA class to its companion object. The newBuildermethod in class RNA simply
forwards to this definition. Second, there is now an implicitCanBuildFrom value in object RNA. To
create such an object you need to define two apply methods in the CanBuildFrom trait. Both create a
new builder for an RNA collection, but they differ in their argument list. The apply() method simply
creates a new builder of the right type. By contrast, the apply(from) method takes the originalcollection as argument. This can be useful to adapt the dynamic type of builder&#8217;s return type to be the
same as the dynamic type of the receiver. In the case of RNA this does not come into play
because RNA is a final class, so any receiver of static type RNA also has RNA as its dynamic type.
That&#8217;s why apply(from) also simply callsnewBuilder, ignoring its argument.
That is it. The RNA class in Listing 25.8 implements all collection methods at their natural types. Its
implementation requires a little bit of protocol. In essence, you need to know where to put
the newBuilder factories and the canBuildFrom implicits. On the plus side, with relatively little code
you get a large number of methods automatically defined. Also, if you don&#8217;t intend to do bulk
operations like take, drop, map, or </code> on your collection, you can choose to not go the extra length and
stop at the implementation shown in Listing 25.6.
The discussion so far centered on the minimal amount of definitions needed to define new sequences
with methods that obey certain types. But in practice you might also want to add new functionality to
your sequences or override existing methods for better efficiency. An example of this is the
overridden foreach method in class RNA. foreach is an important method in its own right because it
implements loops over collections. Furthermore, many other collection methods are implemented in
terms of foreach. So it makes sense to invest some effort optimizing the method&#8217;s implementation.
The standard implementation of foreach in IndexedSeq will simply select every i&#8217;th element of the
collection using apply, where i ranges from 0 to the collection&#8217;s length minus one. So this standard
implementation selects an array element and unpacks a base from it once for every element in an RNA
strand. The overriding foreach in class RNA is smarter than that. For every selected array element it
immediately applies the given function to all bases contained in it. So the effort for array selection and
bit unpacking is much reduced.
Integrating new sets and maps
As a second example you&#8217;ll learn how to integrate a new kind of map into the collection framework.
The idea is to implement a mutable map with String as the type of keys by a "Patricia trie".<span class="footnote"><br />[Morrison, "PATRICIA—Practical Algorithm To Retrieve Information Coded in Alphanumeric" [Mor68]]<br /></span> The
term Patricia is an abbreviation for "Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded in
Alphanumeric." The idea is to store a set or a map as a tree where subsequent characters in a search key
determines uniquely a descendant tree.
For instance, a Patricia trie storing the five strings, "abc", "abd", "al", "all", "xy", would look like the
tree given in Figure 25.1. To find the node corresponding to the string "abc" in this trie, simply follow
the subtree labeled "a", proceed from there to the subtree labeled "b" to finally reach its subtree labeled
"c". If the Patricia trie is used as a map, the value that&#8217;s associated with a key is stored in the nodes that
can be reached by the key. If it is a set, you simply store a marker saying that the node is present in the
set.
import collection._
class PrefixMap[T]
extends mutable.Map[String, T]
with mutable.MapLike[String, T, PrefixMap[T]] {var suffixes: immutable.Map[Char, PrefixMap[T]] = Map.empty
var value: Option[T] = None
def get(s: String): Option[T] =
if (s.isEmpty) value
else suffixes get (s(0)) flatMap (<em>.get(s substring 1))
def withPrefix(s: String): PrefixMap[T] =
if (s.isEmpty) this
else {
val leading = s(0)
suffixes get leading match {
case None &#8658;
suffixes = suffixes + (leading &#8594; empty)
case _ &#8658;
}
suffixes(leading) withPrefix (s substring 1)
}
override def update(s: String, elem: T) =
withPrefix(s).value = Some(elem)
override def remove(s: String): Option[T] =
if (s.isEmpty) { val prev = value; value = None; prev }
else suffixes get (s(0)) flatMap (</em>.remove(s substring 1))
def iterator: Iterator[(String, T)] =
(for (v &#8592; value.iterator) yield ("", v)) +</code>
(for ((chr, m) &#8592; suffixes.iterator;
(s, v) &#8592; m.iterator) yield (chr +: s, v))
def += (kv: (String, T)): this.type = { update(kv.<em>1, kv._2); this }
def -= (s: String): this.type
}
= { remove(s); this }
override def empty = new PrefixMap[T]
Listing 25.10 - An implementation of prefix maps with Patricia tries.
Figure 25.1 - An example Patricia trie.
Patricia tries support very efficient lookups and updates. Another nice feature is that they support
selecting a subcollection by giving a prefix. For instance, in the tree in Figure 25.1you can obtain the
sub-collection of all keys that start with an "a" simply by following the "a" link from the root of the
tree.Based on these ideas we will now walk you through the implementation of a map that&#8217;s implemented as
a Patricia trie. We call the map a PrefixMap, which means that it provides a method withPrefix that
selects a submap of all keys starting with a given prefix.
We&#8217;ll first define a prefix map with the keys shown in Figure 25.1:
scala&gt; val m = PrefixMap("abc" &#8594; 0, "abd" &#8594; 1, "al" &#8594; 2,
"all" &#8594; 3, "xy" &#8594; 4)
m: PrefixMap[Int] = Map((abc,0), (abd,1), (al,2), (all,3),
(xy,4))
Then calling withPrefix on m will yield another prefix map:
scala&gt; m withPrefix "a"
res14: PrefixMap[Int] = Mapbc
Listing 25.10 shows the definition of PrefixMap. This class is parameterized with the type of associated
values T, and extends mutable.Map[String, T] andmutable.MapLike[String, T, PrefixMap[T]]. You
have seen this pattern already for sequences in the RNA strand example. Then as now inheriting an
implementation class such as MapLike serves to get the right result type for transformations such
as filter.
A prefix map node has two mutable fields: suffixes and value. The value field contains an optional
value that&#8217;s associated with the node. It is initialized to None. The suffixes field contains a map from
characters to PrefixMap values. It is initialized to the empty map. You might ask, Why did we pick an
immutable map as the implementation type for suffixes? Would not a mutable map been more standard
since PrefixMap as a whole is also mutable? The answer is that immutable maps that contain only a
few elements are very efficient in both space and execution time.
For instance, maps that contain fewer than 5 elements are represented as a single object. By contrast, as
described in Section 17.2, the standard mutable map is a HashMap, which typically occupies around 80
bytes, even if it is empty. So if small collections are common, it&#8217;s better to pick immutable over
mutable. In the case of Patricia tries, we&#8217;d expect that most nodes, except the ones at the very top of the
tree, would contain only a few successors. So storing these successors in an immutable map is likely to
be more efficient.
Now have a look at the first method that needs to be implemented for a map: get. The algorithm is as
follows: To get the value associated with the empty string in a prefix map, simply select the
optional value stored in the root of the tree. Otherwise, if the key string is not empty, try to select the
submap corresponding to the first character of the string. If that yields a map, follow up by looking up
the remainder of the key string after its first character in that map. If the selection fails, the key is not
stored in the map, so return with None. The combined selection over an option value is elegantly
expressed using flatMap. When applied to an optional value, ov, and a closure, f, which in turn returns
an optional value, ov flatMap f will succeed if both ov and f return a defined value.
Otherwise ov flatMap f will return None.The next two methods to implement for a mutable map are += and -=. In the implementation of Listing
25.10, these are defined in terms of two other methods: update and remove. The removemethod is very
similar to get, except that before returning any associated value, the field containing that value is set
to None. The update method first calls withPrefix to navigate to the tree node that needs to be updated,
then sets the value field of that node to the given value. The withPrefix method navigates through the
tree, creating sub-maps as necessary if some prefix of characters is not yet contained as a path in the
tree.
The last abstract method to implement for a mutable map is iterator. This method needs to produce an
iterator that yields all key/value pairs stored in the map. For any given prefix map this iterator is
composed of the following parts: First, if the map contains a defined value,Some(x), in the value field
at its root, then ("", x) is the first element returned from the iterator. Furthermore, the iterator needs to
traverse the iterators of all submaps stored in the suffixesfield, but it needs to add a character in front of
every key string returned by those iterators. More precisely, if m is the submap reached from the root
through a character chr, and (s, v) is an element returned from m.iterator, then the root&#8217;s iterator will
return (chr +: s, v) instead.
This logic is implemented quite concisely as a concatenation of two for expressions in the
implementation of the iterator method in Listing 25.10. The first for expression iterates
overvalue.iterator. This makes use of the fact that Option values define an iterator method that returns
either no element, if the option value is None, or exactly one element x, if the option value is Some(x).
import scala.collection.mutable.{Builder, MapBuilder}
import scala.collection.generic.CanBuildFrom
object PrefixMap {
def empty[T] = new PrefixMap[T]
def apply[T](kvs: (String, T)*): PrefixMap[T] = {
val m: PrefixMap[T] = empty
for (kv &#8592; kvs) m += kv
m
}
def newBuilder[T]: Builder[(String, T), PrefixMap[T]] =
new MapBuilder[String, T, PrefixMap[T]](empty)
implicit def canBuildFrom[T]
: CanBuildFrom[PrefixMap[</em>], (String, T), PrefixMap[T]] =
new CanBuildFrom[PrefixMap[<em>], (String, T), PrefixMap[T]] {
def apply(from: PrefixMap[</em>]) = newBuilder[T]
def apply() = newBuilder[T]
}
}
Listing 25.11 - The companion object for prefix maps.
Note that there is no newBuilder method defined in PrefixMap. There is no need because maps and sets
come with default builders, which are instances of class MapBuilder. For a mutable map the default
builder starts with an empty map and then adds successive elements using the map&#8217;s += method.Mutable sets behave the same. The default builders for immutable maps and sets use the non-
destructive element addition method +, instead of method +=. However, in all these cases, to build the
right kind of set or map, you need to start with an empty set or map of this kind. This is provided by
the empty method, which is the last method defined inPrefixMap. In Listing 25.10, this method simply
returns a fresh PrefixMap.
We&#8217;ll now turn to the companion object PrefixMap, which is shown in Listing 25.11. In fact it is not
strictly necessary to define this companion object, as class PrefixMap can stand well on its own. The
main purpose of object PrefixMap is to define some convenience factory methods. It also defines
a CanBuildFrom implicit to make typing work out better.
The two convenience methods are empty and apply. The same methods are present for all other
collections in Scala&#8217;s collection framework so it makes sense to define them here too. With the two
methods, you can write PrefixMap literals like you do for any other collection:
scala&gt; PrefixMap("hello" &#8594; 5, "hi" &#8594; 2)
res0: PrefixMap[Int] = Maphello
scala&gt; PrefixMap.empty[String]
res2: PrefixMap[String] = Map()
The other member in object PrefixMap is an implicit CanBuildFrom instance. It has the same purpose
as the CanBuildFrom definition in the last section: to make methods like map return the best possible
type. For instance, consider mapping a function over the key/value pairs of aPrefixMap. As long as that
function produces pairs of strings and some second type, the result collection will again be
a PrefixMap. Here&#8217;s an example:
scala&gt; res0 map { case (k, v) &#8658; (k + "!", "x" * v) }
res8: PrefixMap[String] = Maphello!
The given function argument takes the key/value bindings of the prefix map res0 and produces pairs of
strings. The result of the map is a PrefixMap, this time with value type Stringinstead of Int. Without
the canBuildFrom implicit in PrefixMap the result would just have been a general mutable map, not a
prefix map.
Summary
If you want to fully integrate a new collection class into the framework, you need to pay attention to the
following points:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Decide whether the collection should be mutable or immutable.
Pick the right base traits for the collection.
Inherit from the right implementation trait to implement most collection operations.
If you want map and similar operations to return instances of your collection type, provide an
implicit CanBuildFrom in your class&#8217;s companion object.25.4 CONCLUSION
You have now seen how Scala&#8217;s collections are built and how you can build new kinds of collections.
Because of Scala&#8217;s rich support for abstraction, each new collection type can have a large number of
methods without having to reimplement them all over again.</p></div>
