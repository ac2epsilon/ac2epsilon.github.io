    The purpose of this short test is to assess your ability to solve elementary programming problems in a language of your choice. 
    Write your solutions in Java if you are familiar with that language; otherwise use one of these languages: C, C++, or C#. If you
    do not have access to a compiler for your language, write your answers in a text editor such as notepad and mention in a comment that
    you did not use a compiler.
</p>
<p>
    For each of the problems below, write the simplest, clearest solution you can, in the form of a short program. 
    Answer as much as you can for a problem, even if you do not have the complete answer. 
</p>
<p style="color:red">
    If you are using C or C++ and the function you are writing requires an array parameter then you will also have to have
    a parameter that is the length of the array. This is not necessary in C# or Java since an array is an object in those
    languages and has a length method that returns the length of the array.
</p>
<p>
    You do not need to do any I/O, i.e., you can hard-code your input data and do not have to write out anything to the console.
    Keep it simple! We are primarily interested in what you write in the body of the function. However, please be sure that your solution 
    will work for all valid input data.
</p>
<p>
    The clock is ticking now, so you don't have time to ask for clarifications on any of the questions. If something is not clear
    to you, resolve it yourself and state in a comment in the program what was unclear and how you resolved it.
</p>
<p>
    When you have finished an answer, copy and paste it into the text box associated with the question and click the
    submit button to save it in our database. If you change an answer and submit it again, the previous version of the answer
    will be overwritten with the new version.

    &nbsp;</p><p>1 A <b>123 array</b> is an array that contains multiple repetitions of the values 1, 2, 3 in that order. 
For example {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3} is a 123 array but {1, 2, 3, 1, 2} is not. 
Write a function named <b>is123Array</b> which returns 1 if its array argument is a 123 array,
otherwise it returns 0.</p>
<p>
If you are programming in Java or C#, the function prototype is
int is123Array(int[ ] a)
</p>
<p>
If you are programing in C or C++, the function prototype is
int is123Array(int a[ ], int len) where len is the number of elements in a

&nbsp;<p>2. Define an array to be a <b>121 array</b> if all elements are either 1 or 2 and 
it begins with one or more 1s followed by a one or more 2s and then ends with the same 
number of 1s that it begins with. Write a method named <b>is121Array</b> that returns 1 if 
its array argument is a 121 array, otherwise, it returns 0.</p>

<p>There is one additional requirement. You should return 0 as soon as it is known that the
array is <b>not</b> a 121 array; continuing to analyze the array would be a waste of CPU cycles.</p>

<p>If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is<br>
int is121Array(int[ ] a)</p>

<p>If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature is<br>
int is121Array(int a[ ], int len) where len is the number of elements in the array a.

&nbsp;<p>3. An array is defined to be <b>paired-N</b> if it contains two distinct elements that
sum to N for some specified value of N and the indexes of those elements also sum to N. 
Write a function named isPairedN that returns 1 if its array parameter is a paired-N array. 
The value of N is passed as the second parameter.
</p>
<p>If you are writing in Java or C#, the function signature is<br>
int isPairedN(int[ ] a, int n)</p>
<p>If you are writing in C or C++, the function signature is<br>
int isPairedN(int a[ ], int n, int len) where len is the length of a</p>
<p>There are two additional requirements.</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Once you know the array is paired-N, you should return 1. No wasted loop iterations please.</p></li>
	<li><p>Do not enter the loop unless you have to. You should
		test the length of the array and the value of n to determine whether the array could
	possibly be a paired-N array. If the tests indicate no, return 0 before entering the loop.</p></li>
</ol>
