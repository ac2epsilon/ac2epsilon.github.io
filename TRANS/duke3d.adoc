      Introduction                                                   01.00
 ==================================================================

Life's a beach and then you shoot some aliens in the face.  At least I'm sure that's how the expression goes.  Life's A Beach is by far the best of the three obscure third-party expansions that were released for Duke Nukem 3D. I know that might not seem like much when you consider that the other two come in somewhere between tedious and water torture, but it really is rather good. It's been available on Steam for a while now, which means more than three people are playing it, so here I am.

      Walkthrough                                                    02.00
 ==================================================================

     The walkthrough was written with the Big Kahuna (Come Get Some) difficulty in mind.  Big Kahuna is the third difficulty setting, and the last one to add enemies.  All that really means is that if you're following along on a lower setting, you'll sometimes see me reference enemies that aren't there.  You may be pleasantly surprised on occasion, but I guarantee you'll never be caught off guard and killed until you die from it.

       Par Time: 3:47

After Duke has finished hanging four plus six, he'll wash up in front of the Water Pistol on the beach.  You already have one in your possession, and it's nothing special, but it'll go a way towards dealing with lesser enemies, such as the two Assault Troopers lurking around the corner to the right. Behind their hopefully now-lifeless bodies, your keen eyes will surely espy a Super Soak'em.  It'll be your go-to weapon for the vast majority of the game, a fact hammered home by the plentiful supply of ammo to be found for it, starting with the box of Super Soak'em Shells in the top-right of the area.

Before you saunter into the hotel, have a little look next to the will-be- important-later changing booths to the left for some Suntan Lotion and a Water Pistol Clip.  Inside the hotel, dispatch the three Assault Troopers over to the left, but try to do so without venturing too far into the lobby, as if you do, the pair of Inflatable Sea Monsters around the corner to the right will flollop out and explode you.  Other than your recent addition of several corpses, the lobby can be found to contain a Bunch of Bananas and a Clip.

Further around the corner with the Sea Monsters are two Pig Cops, but they won't be inclined to do anything until you get closer.  Before you go and redecorate a wall with them, dive into the fountain.  This fountain, like hotel fountains in real life, contains a Shark and a Bunch of Bananas.  In the top- left corner is a small hole - surfacing on the other side of it will bring you out in a small room with a waterfall.  [Secret Place 1] can be discovered by diving into the pool below it.  In this place so secret is a box of Pineapples.

Return to the lobby and kill off the Pig Cops with your doom fruit.  If you're
low on health, you can reveal a Bunch of Bananas next to the window by using
the broken telephone.  Head out of said window and have a wander over to the
office on the left.  Inside the office are two Clips and a switch.  The switch,
amigo, opens one of the told-you-they-would-be-important-later changing booths
down on the beach, giving you access to the Yellow Credit Card.

The lock that Card fits into is located in the room behind the reception desk.
It's guarded by three Pig Cops, but the room is pretty small, so a couple of
Del Monte's finest will clear it no trouble.  Opposite the yellow lock, which
we'll get to in a bit, is a box of Shells.  The yellow lock will open a panel
next to it, revealing a far more important switch that powers the lifts out in
the lobby.  We're only interested in the main lift, not the ones by the
telephones.

Inside the lift is a very fabulous Triple Poison Shooter.  While it's a decent enough weapon, the scarcity of ammo renders it little more than a novelty paperweight for the majority of the time.  Presuming you actually rode the lift up, head into the gift shop found around the corner and splat the three Pig Cops.  Behind the counter is some Suntan Lotion.  You can open [Secret Place 2] along the right wall by using the cash register.  Inside that small room, you'll notice two things: firstly a Pearl Health, and secondly a little window. The window, though you've no need of it, can provide and quick and painful way down to the lobby.

Cut a right out of the gift shop.  Grab the Shells and hurl yourself into the water.  If you head through the small hole in the bottom of the wall and surface, you can find a Snorkel.  If you choose to drop down the waterfall rather than be entirely sensible and head out the way you came, you'll wind up back at Secret Place 1.  The rest of this little swim isn't even close to eventful, with it offering up only two boxes of Shells and a likewise number of Bunches of Bananas.  By way of coincidence, two is also the exact number of Sharks to be found here.

Exit the water where you entered it and continue along the path.  Rounding the corner after the Clip will see you come face to belly with your first Assault Commander.  Once it ceases being alive, head across the water to the right. While there's a Bunch of Bananas next to the vending machine if you need them, that's not the neat bit.  The neat bit comes when you use the vending machine to lower the ground behind you, revealing [Secret Place 3].  Don't get too giddy, mind you, as all that's down there is a box of Pineapples.  Oh, and if you're wondering where the lift to the right of the vending machine goes, it leads back to the lobby, and it's never going to feel your love.

Head back across the water and throw as many Pineapples as seems fun into the building the Assault Commander was guarding.  There are four Pig Cops to the left -- but you'll only get three at the best -- and an Assault Trooper over to the right.  Enter the bedroom on the left.  There are two Pig Cops in this room, the most obvious of which being the one sprawled on the bed.  The other one is behind the bar to the left.

You can find a bottle of Hot Sauce in the fridge and some Shells by the window. Destroy the vent cover and jump on up.  This particular vent is entirely linear, so, you know, move in any direction that isn't backwards.  Along the way, you'll be able to get your hands on three lots of Voodoo Ring Ammo, which would be of immediately more use had you the weapon they go in.  In the room at the end is a Pig Cop and a Beach Babe.  The Beach Babe is behind the screen at the back of the room, and is of no particular interest, but if you approach her, three more Pig Cops will spawn in at the door.  Yeah, there's really no reason for you to do that.

In the adjoining room are two Sea Monsters and a pile of toothy goo more commonly known as a Protozoid Slimer.  In terms of things that aren't nailed down, you'll find two Clips.  In the fridge is a switch that'll lower the bars on the window to the left.  Outside and just around the corner, an Assault Commander and two Pig Cops will ambush your face off.  As always, it's nothing that a few Pineapples can't solve.  They won't solve the Seagull following behind them, but it's not exactly a threat.  If you need some health at this point, there's a convenient Bunch of Bananas in the corner.

As you come into hugging distance of the Blue Credit Card that's around the next corner, the hut behind you will open and release an Assault Commander. It was an avid collector of bananas, so you'll find three Bunches of them in the hut.  The TPS Rounds in the corner are pretty obvious, but the Coconut Launcher Ammo in the vent is less so.

If you want a Coconut Launcher to go with them, turn your attention to the switch hidden on the back of the vent - it'll open [Secret Place 4] to the right.  Inside is, well, you know what's inside.  There's also a switch in there, which is less fun, but will open the way back into the first bedroom you entered.  You've obviously no need to be there now, so head back out into the corridor.  If you'd like a Crate of Bananas for your troubles, you can open a panel next to the blue door by using the vending machine.

Continue wandering down the corridor, probably ignoring that Bunch of Bananas, until you reach the window.  Loitering around the corner are three Assault Troopers.  The door they're loitering next to leads into the third bedroom, so it's not important.  Smash the window and hop up onto the ledge.  From there, providing you don't bump your head, you can reach the wooden ledge at the other side of the yard.  If you do happen to fall, you'll find the yard to contain a Holoduke and access to the vent system.  The vent in question contains a switch that'll open the way into the stretch in the accommodation block.

High-five if you made it to the ledge.  To the right is a window, but it's not just any window, it's a window that leads to [Secret Place 5].  Before you get to that, though, there's the formality of shooting an Assault Trooper in the face.  Immediately inside of the room is an Octabrain, your first one, and a Sea Monster.  Down by the bed is a bottle of Suntan Lotion.  If you want the Crate of Bananas from the fridge in the adjoining room, you'll have to brave six Octabrains and four Slimer Eggs.  They're ridiculously tightly packed, so dealing with them shouldn't be an issue.

Return to the accommodation block and head through the blue door, but don't take the lift just yet.  Shoot out the window at the top of the right wall and jump outside for a bottle of Suntan Lotion.  Doing the same with the other window will get you a Bunch of Bananas.  Regardless of what window you hurled yourself through, you'll be able to reach the top of the walkway.  The switch there will open the wall to the right of it, presenting you with a way to the roof, providing you make the jump across to it.  The pair of Slimers waiting for you are barely worth a mention, but there you go, I mentioned them.

The roof is actually [Secret Place 6], so that's nice.  There's a Seagull waiting for you up there, but it can't come into the stairwell, and will quite probably get itself stuck.  There are four vents running along the back wall – all of which, with the exception of one, contain an item.  The first one, from the left, will drop you into the vent system.  From the rest, you can get a Bunch of Bananas, Triple Poison Shooter Rounds, and a Voodoo Ring.  Voodoo Ring Ammo is quite rare, but the only regular enemies worth using it on are Assault Commanders, so there's no danger of running short.

Inside the vent, take the left branch for some Conchanator Ammo.  You can drop down behind it for a chance at more stuff, but don't get ahead of yourself. Head back the way you came and continue straight.  The three lots of Ice Crusher Ammo to be found here are nice and all, but you've yet to find the weapon they go in.  All the way at the end of this section of duct is a small area that holds a Conchanator.  The switch on the wall near to it will open the shutter, allowing you to drop down to the walkway outside of the accommodation area.  It's a one way deal, so head back to the left branch and drop down.

Because choices are fun, you'll have another choice of routes.  Well, sort of. Continuing straight ahead will bring you out in the lobby, while heading left will allow you to reach a sort of hidden area behind the yard you crossed to reach the office.  You don't have to jump from the vent to land behind the wall, if that's what you're worried about - you just have to strafe run. The reward for your endeavours is a Voodoo Ring and a Seagull in the face.

The wall is normally too high to jump over, but while you're here, a large section of it will lower just enough for you to get back over.  Using that lowered section of wall, you can reach the Crate of Bananas that's been leering at you for some time now.  Wild tangent over, return to the accommodation block and actually ride the lift down this time.

At the bottom, you'll immediately be made aware, via your eye-holes, that there are three Clips on the walkway.  What your eye-holes can't immediately tell you is that there are two boxes of TPS Rounds in the water, in the merry company of three Sharks.  Inside the bar proper, you'll be set upon by three Pig Cops, which is a pretty good incentive not go into the bar.

The floor of the bar is rotating clockwise because reasons, and you have Pineapples, also because reasons.  Throw a couple into the bar from a safe distance and wait for them to cycle round.  If you hit one of the dancing girls (and let's face it, explosives), an Assault Trooper will spawn in at her position to give you a good telling off.  Speaking of Assault Troopers, there are two tending bar.  The wine rack behind the bar can be opened to discover [Secret Place 7], which holds a Beach Babe (no idea) and a pair of Sunglasses.

Both the exits to this room lead to the same place, each one with a couple of Clips nearby.  If you take the right exit, though, you can grab some Voodoo Trip Bombs on the way out.  Between the two corridors run a vent, inside of which lives some Conchanator Ammo.  In the karaoke lounge, take a little wander over to the stage.  Yes, there's a box of Shells on the left speaker and a Bunch of Bananas behind the right one, but that's not the bit I wanted to show you.  The stage is actually a lift, and will take you down to [Secret Place 8], a tiny room that holds your first Ice Crusher.

The exit to the lounge is indicated by the large arrows on the wall, which is convenient.  I suppose the Clips to be had on the way out are also sort of convenient.  In the slightly out-of-place game room, there's some pretty nice things up for grabs.  The aim of the game is to shoot the buttons to open the doors and, well, that's it, really.  Open the doors and grab the items as they go past.

The most notable item is the Red Credit Card, but there's also: two Clips, a Pearl Health, Shells, Suntan Lotion, Hot Sauce, a Bunch of Bananas, Conchanator Ammo, Ice Crusher Ammo, Protective Sandals, and a single Voodoo Trip Bomb. The Sandals will make your life easier later, so if you can only be bothered to grab one extra item,you know.

Fighting five Octabrains in amongst four Slimer Eggs is all the rage these days, so head down the stairs and be trendy.  There's some TPS Rounds in the corner, and they'll go some way towards the room-clearing, though blowing them up is more fun and/or practical.  The broken telephone will open [Secret Place 9] just to the right of it, and that'll give you some Coconut Launcher Ammo, which is nice.  The lift here leads to the pool, but by time you reach the point where it unlocks, you'll already be in the place it leads to.  So, yeah, a bit redundant.

Head back to the red door, Holmes.  Four Pig Cops are waiting for you at the bottom of the lift, so you may want to send a Holoduke and a few Pineapples as an advance party.  You won't get them all, but you may well lure a couple into the blast.  Who knows what's around the next corner?  I do - a Sea Monster. Using the vending machine, as appears to be the trend, will open a small panel with a goody behind it.  The panel in this case being next to the lift, and the goody in question being a box of Conchanator Ammo.  As you're wandering down the corridor, make a mental note of the screens down the right side.  Out in the pool area is an Assault Commander and three Sea Monsters.

The Sea Monsters are bobbing about happily in the pool and won't pose an immediate threat, providing you hang back a bit when dealing with the Assault Commander.  Once you've declared adult swim, dive into the pool and flip the switch.  The screens in the corridor are gone and the exit is now open, so go, you know, finish the level.

        Secrets: 7
        Enemies: 110
       Par Time: 5:35
 3D Realms Time: 2:27

Have a wander over to the window at the back of the cell to trigger your means of escape.  Said means of escape happens to be a runaway tour bus, so I'd advise against standing there for too long.  If you weren't quick enough in getting out the way, it doesn't really matter, as there are two Bunches of Bananas on your bunk.  Head out through the once-was-a-wall and cut a sharp left.

Blow open the wall next to the Shells to find [Secret Place 1], which will reward you with a Coconut Launcher.  Of course, first you'll need to take care of the Pig Cops up on the balcony, but better to do it from here than from down on the street.  Speaking of the street, the Seagull flitting about down there is also much easier to tackle from up here.  You'll also be able to draw a bead on the Pig Cop in the window of the building opposite.

You're not done up here yet, though, as the Sea Monster at the end of the street likely spotted you as you collected the Coconut Launcher, and has flolloped its way over.  You can either feed it a Pineapple or wait until it's close enough and trick into blowing itself up.

Descend from thy lofty perch and head into the building that housed the Pig Cop.  Inside of which, you'll meet some small resistance in the form of two Assault Troopers.  To your right are two Clips, and around the back of the crates is some Coconut Launcher Ammo.  In the room off to the left is a nice Crate of Bananas.  Head back onto the street and make your way to the left. Once you pass the dumpster on your way to the Shells, a Sea Monster will spawn inside of it.  If you could throw a Pineapple in there beforehand, that'd be pretty handy.

In the aforementioned receptacle, you can find a Triple Poison Shooter, which is sort of nice.  With that small and smelly excursion finished, head over to the opposite end of the street.  We're heading into the convenience store on the left, but there are two boxes of Shells near the market entrance to the right, if you'd like to grab them first.  In the alley is a lone box of Shells, and through the window is some target practice.  Immediately inside the store are two Pig Cops, and just to the right is an Assault Trooper.

In terms of items, all that there is are two Clips.  Yeah, I know.  However, if you activate the Cha-Cha poster, you'll open the matching one outside the store, revealing [Secret Place 2].  Straight inside, you'll be accosted by a Pig Cop and an Assault Trooper.  There's also some Coconut Launcher Ammo here, but you'll be pleased to know that it won't accost you in the slightest.

The market is quite large and has plenty of places you can be ambushed from. There's another Pig Cop and Assault Trooper pairing just around the corner - just make sure you don't stroll too far out to deal with them, as the building on the left -- the fishmongers -- hides a Sea Monster.  On the partition behind you is a box of Shells, and just behind that partition, as you make your way towards the building on the right, a Sea Monster will spawn - so be careful.

In the building on the right lives an Assault Trooper and a couple of Pig Cops. If you're a materialist, you'll be somewhat disappointed by the Clips, Shells, and the Single Banana in the vent.  Along the front wall is a trough of oranges, that if you were to stand in the middle of them and crouch, you'd fall through and land in an area with an exit that leads to a secret level (A Full House).  Once you do that, mind you, you can't get back up.

Excellent well, to the fishmongers.  Through the door to the right is a Pig Cop - his Assault Trooper friend is looking in the window, the weirdo.  The little tub leads to [Secret Place 3], a tiny room with two Bunches of Bananas and some Suntan Lotion.  Back in the fishmongers, yeah, head around the corner marked by the restricted area sign and be ready for a trio of Octabrains.

Outside, you'll find one more Octabrain accompanied by three Assault Troopers and a Seagull.  Once they're down, this whole area will be secure.  In the rowing boat, as you can see, is a bottle of Hot Sauce.  If you can be bothered to take a swim in amongst the four Octabrains and the three Sharks, you can come away with a Snorkel, a Bunch of Bananas, and a Single Banana, which to be fair, is a bit rubbish.

As you go to make your way out of the fishmongers (providing you don't exit the way you came in by), you'll see another vent with a Single Banana.  Like the previous vent, it's blocked, but that can be remedied.  In the main area, next to the box of Pineapples, you'll see a very faint crack in the wall - blasting open the wall will allow you to grab two Bunches of Bananas and some Shells. Head back out onto the main street and head towards the market you previously ignored.

Just inside are two boxes of Shells, followed presently by and equal number of Pig Cops to use them on.  Other than a further two boxes of Shells, the shop is bare.  Head through the curtain at the back and into the storeroom.  In between the crates to the left is the first of two Slimer Eggs, the second of which being in the open crate.  There's a box of Shells in there, which will go along nicely with the two on the floor.  Out on the street is a total of four Assault Troopers, a Pig Cop, and an Assault Commander.  It's like a surprise party, except the surprise is you die.

If you sidle out of the door, you'll be able to pick off one Assault Trooper before it causes you any hassle.  Doing that, mind you, will trigger the Pig Cop to very slowly make its way up to you - rather than wait for that to happen, just throw a Pineapple over the edge and take both it and the concealed Assault Trooper out.  The Assault Commander and the remaining Assault Troopers are far enough away to give you options.

The red door can be found just next to the stairs, just so you know.  To save time and effort later, peek through the window and shoot the Assault Trooper in the face or the back of the head or whatever, because I'm not picky.  In the alley to the left of it are two boxes of Shells.  If you stand on the wall with the Clips, you'll be able to jump through the window of the building for [Secret Place 4].

In the back room is a Pearl Health and an unrivalled view of the Seagull that's lurking in the alley behind the building.  Below it are two Pig Cops, but they can be dispensed with via the usual means of dropping a Pineapple on them. Down by their piggy corpses, you'll find some Suntan Lotion and a box of Shells.

The only other exit from this area is through the indoor market.  You can enter through the main door or head over the top of the tour bus and through the back way, grabbing a Clip for your troubles.  In the alley behind the bus is a Pig Cop and his best friend, Assault Trooper.  Throw a Pineapple or two from the top of the bus in the direction of the Cha-Cha poster, then head into the market via the main door.

There are a few of the usual suspects occupying the market, but it's not overly hard to avoid triggering them all at once, providing you stay away from the middle of the area.  Just inside the entrance is a Pig Cop (trouble) and a couple of boxes of Shells (for your troubles).  Around the corner by the crates is another Pig Cop, this time coupled with an Assault Trooper.  As you approach the blue lock, a Pig Cop will spawn in the air behind you, inexplicably lying down.  Inside of the crate on the left wall (which will be to the right if you turned around to deal with the Pig Cop) is a Conchanator.

In the centre of the market is a completely surprise pairing of a Pig Cop and an Assault Trooper.  The only goodies up for grabs here are a Clip and a box of Shells.  The yellow door lives here, so now you have no excuse for not knowing where it is.  Out in the alley, behind the bus from earlier, is a lone Voodoo Trip Bomb.  Exit the market via the back door and get ready to fight a dinosaur!  Kidding, it's another Pig Cop and Assault Trooper.  Grab the Shells behind the counter, then head into the warehouse opposite.

Once you've dispatched the two Assault Troopers, turn to face the crate in the middle of the room.  From there, you can reach a switch that will open [Secret Place 5] to the left of the Suntan Lotion at the back of the area.  Inside of which is a Pearl Health, which is nice.  Back outside and just around the corner to the left is a Sea Monster.  Unless you sprout wings, the Yellow Credit Card atop the pillar in the fountain will currently be out of your reach.

Sightseeing out of the way, the trio of Assault Troopers occupying this area will have no doubt spotted you, so you'll probably want to sort that, preferably without heading too far into the area.  Behind that counter is a switch that'll open the curtain inside the next area and spawn a Sea Monster and Assault Trooper, and revealing an Assault Commander, so you may want to clear it out first, then come back.

The reason I didn't want you heading too far into the area is the two Sea Monsters are waiting to bombard you from the exit over to the right.  One of them is obscured by the wall, so you'll want something splashy.  Before you depart, you can grab a couple of Voodoo Trip Bombs from betwixt the fountain and the wall.  Just to the right of the Sea Monsters, you can nab a couple of Clips off the counter, which will go absolutely no way towards splatting the three Assault Troopers, Pig Cop, and Sea Monster in the next room.  Behind the large wooden beam on the left side is some Shells.  The beam itself can be cracked open to reveal a Bunch of Bananas.

Once the curtains are open and everything is fifty shades of dead, head on through to the stage area.  Out enjoying the show, in no particular order: two Assault Troopers, a Sea Monster, and an Assault Commander.  The Commander is camped around the corner to the right, just behind the palm tree, and will probably be the one that'll cause you the most trouble if you run in guns blazing.  Upon the stage are two boxes of TPS Rounds.  Head into the area beside the stage and ride the lift up to find two Bunches of Bananas and the Red Credit Card.

If you look out of the window, you'll see a button that you couldn't from the ground, due to one-way wall trickery.  Shooting it will open [Secret Place 6] to its right, rewarding you with a Crate of Bananas.  When you collected the Red Credit Card, you couldn't have helped but notice stirrings of enemy activity: those enemies being an Assault Commander and an Assault Trooper. The Trooper spawns behind the tour bus from earlier, while the Commander spawns on the opposite side.

Through the red door, you'll find, in addition to the Assault Trooper you assaulted earlier, an Assault Trooper and a Pig Cop.  At the top of the stairs are two lots of Ice Crusher Ammo and the switch that's responsible for putting the Yellow Credit Card within arm's reach.  It's also responsible for the two Assault Troopers and an Assault Commander out in the street.  It's not really as bad as it sounds, as the Commander is likely to indulge in a little friendly fire, damaging itself in the process.  Plus, the window makes pretty great cover.

As soon as you open the yellow door, you'll almost immediately be shot in the face by a Pig Cop - might want to avoid that.  You might also want to watch for the Assault Trooper in the stairwell.  There's a Clip to be had near to it, so, you know.  When you reach the top, you'll be accosted by a second Pig Cop. You should be able to just about see the elbow of an Assault Commander poking out around the corner to the left - finish it quickly, as you don't want it throwing explosives around in such close confines.

At the end of corridor is an Assault Trooper, and behind the counter to the left is a Pig Cop.  The Cha-Cha poster behind the Assault Trooper can be opened for a Voodoo Ring.  Down the right branch, on the second bed, is an Assault Trooper and a Pig Cop (creepy love is creepy).  There are two lots Voodoo Ring Ammo to be found next to the bed by the window.

Room 1 is the only room you can enter, though you might want to listen to what Duke has to say about entering the others.  Inside are two Assault Troopers, Shells, and the Blue Credit Card.  Once you lay your hand upon said Card, two Sea Monsters will spawn outside the yellow door.  Before you go down and do something that involves their deaths, turn your attention towards the window, which gives and unrivalled view of the final area.

You'll want to hang back a bit, as there's more than the three Assault Troopers and two Pig Cops that are immediately obvious - there are also two Sentry Drones, and though they can't quite fit through the window, their explosion doesn't much care.  The door at the top of the stairs opens out into the store from earlier, just in case you're thinking of swinging back for the secret exit.  Speaking of stairs, the back of the staircase can be opened for [Secret Place 7], which will rather nicely offer up a Pearl Health.

Two Sharks and three Octabrains can be found lurking below the surface of the water, but your reward for dealing with them is only one box of Shells and a Bunch of Bananas.  The exit to the level, like you need me to tell you, is onboard the dinky ship that goes by the name of the 'Kobayashi Maru.'

Yes, you read right, there aren't any secret areas.  Well, there aren't any that actually count - but there are still plenty of uncounted areas kicking about.  The first such sort-of-secret can be found at the start of the level, hopefully after you've shot the pair of Pig Cops in the face.  The black panels at either side of them can be opened to reveal a Super Soak'em (left) and three Clips (right).  Jumping into the fountain in front of you will get you a Bunch of Bananas and a Clip, and will also give you a glimpse of the Red Credit Card.

Exit the fountain, of course, and take the left path.  There are two Pig Cops all the way at the bottom of the stairs by the red door, and to the right are two more Pig Cops and an Assault Trooper.  Behind the croupier's table is a switch that'll open the wall in front of you, but before you do that, you might want to deal with the Assault Trooper that's down the stairs to the right and grab the TPS Rounds near the table.  The not-secret place, if you're really desperate to know, will give you a Coconut Launcher.

Progress can be made by heading down the stairs and through the door to the left of the red door.  Inside, you'll encounter two Pig Cops.  On the desk is a Super Soak'em and Shells, and behind the door is a bottle of Suntan Lotion. The rightmost security monitor is a fake, and can be opened for a Pearl Health. Shoot the button to the right of the monitor to reveal a switch next to it. The switch will unlock the lift that can be found by taking the right path from the start.  Guess where you need to go.

At the bottom of the stairs are some Shells, and around the corner to the left are three Assault Troopers and a Pig Cop.  They're followed by, at the bottom of the next set, two Assault Troopers and a Pig Cop.  Nearby, a box of Shells and a Bunch of Bananas leer at you menacingly.  This croupier's table, like the one previous, has a switch behind it.  Pressing it will open the lights to your right, revealing a Triple Poison Shooter.

At either side of the first floor corridor is a Pig Cop and an Assault Trooper. It's also worth noting that you'll find the blue and yellow doors in this area. The fountain here is connected to the one in the lobby, so a quick dive will net you the Red Credit Card.  Be sure to open the bars using the switch to provide a dandy shortcut.  Collecting the Red Credit Card has the undesired effect of repopulating some of the casino floor.  You don't want to be down there just yet, so head back up and take a wander over to the vent opposite the yellow door.

Make your way through the happy little vent and drop down to find a hidden area containing a Pearl Health, Suntan Lotion, and some Coconut Launcher Ammo. The switch here will lower one of the fruit machines out on the casino floor, allowing you to get out.  Because you repopulated the area just before (silly you), resistance will begin immediately to your right with a Pig Cop and an Assault Trooper.  Further to that, two Pig Cops can be found by the croupier's table on the left side, another by the fountain (along with a magically- appearing box of Shells), and two Assault Troopers can be found hanging out near the telephones.

With the floor cleared for a second time, you're free to enter the red door without being shot in the back of the head.  Serving as bouncer to the Shipwreck Lounge is an Assault Commander.  At either side of you, barring access to each toilet, is an Assault Trooper.  Take care of them, obviously, then head into the gents.  The second stall from the right holds a box of Coconut Launcher Ammo, and the far right stall holds an Assault Trooper in the middle of, well, you know.

Head into the vent and follow it to its conclusion, that being a small room with a box of Pineapples and two Slimer Eggs.  Following the vent from here brings you around to the second set of toilets, the sum total of its contents being a Bunch of Bananas.  Into the Shipwreck Lounge it is, then.  Around the corner are two Sea Monsters, and tending bar to the left are two Assault Troopers.

To the right of the karaoke stage is a Triple Poison Shooter.  Before you continue, have a little look in the fish tank to the right.  The Blue Credit Card and two Sharks, oh yes.  To save effort later, the Sharks can be put out of your misery with a blast from a concussive weapon.  Activating the left-hand speaker on the stage will lower the one on the right, opening a secret room with a Pearl Health, a Conchanator, and two lots of Conchanator Ammo.

Behind the bar, on the wine rack on the left side, is a switch that will open the one over on the right.  Before you do that, though, you might want to go grab the Shells that's with you behind the bar.  In the aforementioned area is a pair of Slimer Eggs, and behind them the lift that will take you to the maintenance area.  At the top, you're presented with another box of Shells and a chance to put it to use.  You see, around to the right are three Octabrains and two Slimer Eggs.

In this area, you'll find three tanks, which as you can probably guess, connect to the ones down in the Shipwreck Lounge.  There's a large one in the centre of the room and a smaller one at either side.  There are also two lots of TPS Rounds off to the right.  Around by the tank to the left is a Slimer Egg, a Snorkel, and a Bunch of Bananas.  The tank itself holds a Shark and a Crate of Bananas.

As you head towards the tank on the right side, you'll be greeted by another Octabrain.  There's a Slimer Egg here, but even the Egg doesn't care.  By the tank is a Bunch of Bananas, and in it is a lone Shark and a Coconut Launcher. The central tank holds three Sharks - five if you didn't kill the two from the bar.  It also holds the Blue Credit Card.  As you can see through the glass, the lounge has been repopulated by two Assault Troopers and a Pig Cop.

As you surface, you'll find that a crafty Octabrain has spawned in and is waiting for you.  Make your way back down to the bar and depopulate it once again.  Around the corner, back at the entrance to the Lounge, you'll come across an Assault Commander.  The casino floor, as is the theme, has once again been repopulated by several more enemies.  Well, four.  There's a Pig Cop and an Assault Trooper to your left as you head out of the door, and a second pairing near the lift to the second floor.  As for the second floor, a lone Assault Trooper is hanging around to the right.  Head into the blue door.

Kill the pair of Assault Troopers and examine the vending machine to reveal a small room with a box of Shells and a Bunch of Bananas.  As you enter the restaurant, there's a Sea Monster immediately to your left, with an Assault Trooper coming up behind.  There's a Bunch of Bananas in the booth to the left if you need it.  At the bottom of the stairs, you're given both a box of TPS Rounds and a little choice: you can either head left, into the kitchen, or you can head back around to the right for a little secret.  Either way, you'll have to dispatch the two Pig Cops to the right before you can continue.  Yeah, you want the secret area, I know.

In the booth to the right of the foot of the stairs is some TPS Rounds. In front of you, at the top of the next set of stairs, is an Assault Trooper. This is both relevant because it's trying to murder you and because you should head up those stairs.  At the top, have a little look under the table to spot a little room hidden behind it.  You won't get anything special from it, but a box of Pineapples and a pair of Sunglasses is always appreciated.

If you head left after exiting this little room, you'll be able to find a box of Shells in the booth that's to the right of the entrance door (your left). Inside the kitchen, there lurks three Pig Cops and an Assault Trooper.  To make you feel a little better, there's some TPS Rounds by the island, a box of Shells behind the door, and a Crate of Bananas in the first-aid kit to the right of the freezer door.

Head over to that very door and shoot the Assault Trooper through the glass for fun and profit.  The door is locked, but you can reach it by means of a vent located above the range.  It's a bit of a pain to get inside without sort of burning yourself to death, but any loss of health can be mitigated by the Pearl Health waiting for you once you get up.  In the vent, resist the urge to take the first right, as all that will do is drop you down to the room between the toilets from earlier.  In the freezer is an Ice Crusher and two lots of Ice Crusher Ammo, along with the switch that opens the door, thankfully.  Oh, and two Octabrains have spawned in the kitchen and want to fillet you.

To make progress, you need the Yellow Credit Card, and to get that, you need to shove yourself into the plate-washer to the left of the entrance door and press the switch.  The thing is full of steam, so expediency is advised.  The button will unlock the pantry to the right of the freezer.  Found along with the Yellow Credit Card is some Coconut Launcher Ammo.  Oh, and you'll spawn some fresh enemies in.  Just around the corner from the kitchen is a Sea Monster, two Assault Troopers can be found roaming the right side of the restaurant, and back out in the second floor lobby is a Pig Cop and an Assault Trooper. The casino floor, for once, stays unoccupied.

Head through the yellow door, silly, where you can enjoy immediately being jumped by three Assault Trooper and a Sea Monster.  In the area to the left, there will be another Assault Trooper sticking its head through the gap. Before you move on, you can grab some Shells and a Bunch of Bananas from this area, and some TPS Rounds from the area to the left.

Down on the dock, two Assault Troopers and an Assault Commander await to do honourable battle with you.  Or you can just chuck a bunch of Pineapples down on their heads from the deck.  If you cut a sharp left from the bottom of the stairs and follow the dock around, you'll find a Pearl Health.  There's a Bunch of Bananas and TPS Rounds to the right of the stairs, also.  The Kobayashi Maru sits faithfully in front of you, and once again serves as the exit.

      Mr. Splashy's                                                  02.04

In front of you, though you can't quite see it because of the bow of the boat, is a Super Soak'em.  To your left, much more interestingly, is a crack in the wall.  If you're low on kaboom, some Pineapples can be found underwater. There are five Pig Cops behind the wall, but as to how many come spilling out, your guess is as good as mine.  One might get through, or they may all be engulfed in the slightly larger than expected explosion.

You'll find the entrance to the park closed, but inside the booth to the right, along with a Bunch of Bananas, is the switch that operates the gates.  As you enter the booth, six Pig Cops will spawn behind the gate.  They may not all rush the gate at once, with some opting to hang back around the corner, so mind that.  You might want to set up some Voodoo Trip Bombs close to the gate to stamp their hands permanent-like.

Head through the newly-opened gate and hop into the water.  You'll find a Bunch of Bananas, but more pressingly, you'll find an Octabrain behind each of the three columns.  In the corner, the wall can be destroyed to reveal a fourth Octabrain and another Bunch of Bananas.  Oh, and if you head inside and swim to the surface, you'll find [Secret Place 1].  In terms of rewards, all there is to find is a Snorkel - it's guarded by three Slimer Eggs (well, as guarded as anything can be by eggs - which is to say, not particularly well).

Return to the surface and follow the path in the obvious direction.  There are some Shells by the gate, but you can't really miss them.  When you see Tadpoles Wild Ride, be aware that around the corner to the right are two Pig Cops and a Sea Monster.  As you make your way along the queue path, you can grab a Bunch of Bananas and some more Shells.  Trigger the switch next to the ride console to open the shutters.

Enter the ride the wrong way, you reckless fool, and head over to the volcano. Behind which is a box of Coconut Launcher Ammo.  On the wall opposite the volcano, you'll see the window for the ride control room - inside is a Slimer Egg and three Pig Cops.  The Egg is too far back to hit, but using the Coconut Launcher, you'll at least be able to deal with the Pig Cops now rather than later and in an enclosed space.  The ideal spot to do this is from atop the volcano.

Head out the way you came in and enter the ride from the proper side this time. There's nothing to do but go with the flow until you reach the building with flames in the windows.  Grab the Suntan Lotion from outside and hop through a window of your choosing.  Inside, shoot the barrels to bypass the door, then saunter over to the locked door and liberate the Triple Poison Shooter. While you're there, plant a Voodoo Trip Bomb across the doorway for reasons that will become more apparent when things start to explode.

Head through the hole in the wall (there's Bunch of Bananas to the left, just so you know) and take care of the Slimer Egg and Octabrain in the lift, then ride it up to the control room.  The room is devoid of Pig Cops, but not of TPS Rounds or that Slimer you couldn't hit before.  The switch next to the monitor opens the locked door on the floor down, while the switch on the right opens the gate from earlier.  When you open the locked door, three Pig Cops will rush through, right into the Voodoo Trip Bomb, which probably won't kill them outright, but will do a number on them.

Head back down and make your way through that very door and follow the corridor along.  Between each of the columns on this side of the water is a box of Shells.  Over on the other side is, seemingly, just a Crate of Bananas. Not everything is as it appears, as the walls between both of the columns are transparent, and lead to [Secret Place 2].  The area is bifurcated by a Voodoo Trip Bomb, so be careful.  Down either side of it are four Voodoo Trip Bombs.

Drop into the water and let it carry you back around to the exit.  When you get there, you'll be accosted by four Pig Cops: three in the boat and one in the queue (currently to your left).  There's a fifth one just through the entrance, but it won't activate until you head around the corner, which you have no need to do.

Progress is found through the newly-opened gate.  Just around the corner, you will encounter a Sea Monster.  There's a Slimer Egg next to it, but we don't care.  They're a good length away from you, so there's no jumping out and surprising the Sea Monster.  There's a further six Eggs on the stairs, and you'll want to take them out from a distance, as getting too close to the shutter is going to spawn several -- well, four -- Octabrains behind you. Two or three Voodoo Trip Bombs about halfway up the stairs will either weaken them all greatly before they get to you or just blow their little arms off.

Open the shutters and take care of the Pig Cop behind the door immediately to the left.  Just around the corner from the River Adventure, you'll find three Assault Troopers at a table.  On the wall directly opposite them are two boxes of Shells.  If you need some health, two Bunches of Bananas sit opposite the bar.

Speaking of the bar, behind it is a pair of Assault Troopers.  With them dead and dead, trigger the cola machine to open the chalk board on the wall, revealing some Hot Sauce.  Head down the stairs but stop when you see the boxes with the Shells and TPS Rounds in front.  Around the corner to the right is a room full of generally unpleasant things.  In total, there are two Octabrains and six Slimer Eggs.  The room is tiny, so anything with splash damage is preferred (you may as well use Pineapples, as there's a box of them inside).

The vent is blocked by a carelessly-placed crate.  To get it out of the way, head around the side of the crate stack in the middle of the room and look for a hand print button.  Following that vent to its conclusion will take you to [Secret Place 3], which contains a Pearl Health.  As a bit of a bonus, you can pick off an Assault Commander through the window.  Head back up the stairs and exit the bar, then head down the stairs that wrap around the outside of it.

Just out of view to the right of where the Assault Commander was, a Sea Monster waits in ambush - the idea being that it explodes you when you step out to grab the Voodoo Ring Ammo or fight the Assault Commander.  When you see the Wave Pool, watch for the two Pig Cops to your left.  Going for a swim isn't overly rewarding, but if you insist.  In amongst the Shark quintet, there are two Bunches of Bananas, some Shells and TPS Rounds, and a Voodoo Ring.  The Voodoo Ring can be found under the walkway where you entered by, the rest can be found by simply swimming around the outside of the area.

With that out of your system, head inside the Keelboat Ride via the entrance. There are four Clips here, which is coincidentally the exact same number of the Pig Cops waiting for you at the end of the queue path.  Jump into the water and let the current carry you outside, then dive into the water along side the track.  You'll find five more Sharks, two Bunches of Bananas, and some Shells. More importantly, in the middle of the area is the Blue Credit Card.  Return to the River Adventure Ride you passed earlier and open the door.

Dutifully follow the queue path around, snaffling the Pineapples and killing the Assault Trooper waiting in ambush at the end (to the right).  Hop into the water, and as is the theme, let it carry you along.  There's nothing to keep an eye out for as you bob along, so relax.  Behind the waterfall is an area that contains four Octabrains and six Slimer Eggs.  Rather than attempting to deal with them once they're active, you're best off just blind-firing explosives through the waterfall - you'll likely kill everything with the exception of two Eggs on the left.  Near those Eggs is a box of Shells, and behind the large pyramid is a Conchanator.

Get out of the water and head through the black-painted exit door to reach the control room.  At the bottom of the stairs, you'll find two Clips and a switch. Triggering the switch will open the wall behind you, seeing you ambushed by a lone Pig Cop.  In his little alcove is the Yellow Credit Card and two Bunches of Bananas.  Head back up and hop into the water.  With the one exception of three Assault Troopers as you approach the elephant, the rest of the ride is uneventful.

As you make your way back to the Keelboat Ride, you'll encounter four Pig Cops in the water alongside the path (they can, but seldom ever want to, get out). The yellow lock (at the end of the queue path, of course) opens the shutters at the top of the ramp.  Hop into the water and go for a ride.  As you come out of the tunnel, there's a hidden lift at either side of the track (you can call it while standing on the edge - just look down to see it).  Down on the left side is some Coconut Launcher Ammo and down on the right side is a Coconut Launcher.

Continue along the track, and when you reach the metal barrier, hop up onto it. There are three Sea Monsters around the corner, one of which you can see. When it spots you, it'll get overexcited and kill its friends and quite possibly itself, which is awesome.  For you.  To the right side of the ramp, you can find some Shells.  Right next to that is a door you should make a mental note of.

As you round the corner at the top of the ramp, you'll be accosted by four Pig Cops.  The prop temple behind them holds an Ice Crusher and a Bunch of Bananas. As you approach the temple after the tunnel, put a spurt on, as there's a Sentry Drone at either side of the track.  Speed up, turn, kill stuff, carry on down the track.  With the exception of killing the Pig Cop in the booth and grabbing the TPS Rounds, there's no real incentive to get out of the water. At the bottom of the slide, on the left side, is a box of Conchanator Ammo.

In the tunnel, the water current will speed up.  Jumping through one of the holes in the left wall will see you discover [Secret Place 4], which offers up some Pineapples.  Doing the same on the opposite side of the tunnel will see you discover [Secret Place 5], which offers up a Crate of Bananas.  When the track brings you outside again, you'll find another hidden lift to the left, which will take you down to an area with two lots of Ice Crusher Ammo.

The next control booth you reach is far more interesting.  Throw a Pineapple over the back wall and blow a hole in the booth wall, then follow it over and trigger the switch.  Said switch is responsible for opening the noteworthy door from earlier.  And yes, that necessitates another lap of the track.  Yeah, you know you love it.  Inside, you'll find the Red Credit Card in the company of four Octabrains and three Slimer Eggs.  The support columns are much too small to hide behind, but they're still far too good at stopping your shots.  You can get back to the start quicker by opening the shutter at the back of the room. The Card, if you aren't sure, opens the Wave Pool opposite the Keelboat Ride.

Directly behind the shutters is a pair of Assault Commanders backed up by a Sea Monster.  The Conchanator is pretty much your only chance of survival that doesn't involve hiding in the water.  The Wave Pool is pretty sparse on the collectible front, with there only being just the two Bunches of Bananas. They're situated near the totally not suspicious tiny vent, by the way.

At the back of the Wave Pool is a switch - the idea is to jump up to it as the wave pushes you up.  When you're about halfway across, a cavalcade of enemies will spawn behind you (10 Assault Troopers, 2 Pig Cops, and 4 Sea Monsters). With a bit of creative strafing, the Inflatables near the back will kill just about everything, including themselves.  Alternatively, if you can trigger the switch, you'll send a volley of shrinking beams in their direction.

Shrinking yourself will allow you to get through that small vent.  Just be mindful of taking too long, because you don't want to return to your regular size in an irregular place.  Making your way towards the tunnels marked with question marks will trigger an explosion near the babes, opening a way back to the Wave Pool.  It'll also trigger the spawn of three more Pig Cops, who will promptly be reduced in size by the still-active shrinker.

Each of those chutes end up in the same place, but they each offer a different prize.  The first tunnel will offer a Conchanator, the second has an Ice Crusher, the third has a Triple Poison Shooter, and the fourth has a Coconut Launcher.  The tunnels are designed in such a way that you cannot grab the item from one and head back out, so choose sort of wisely.  Waiting for you at the bottom is the ever-faithful Kobayashi Maru.

Look down, back up - where are you?  You're on a boat with a Crate of Bananas.  The switch is impossible to miss, which is just as well, because it's responsible for working the boat lift.  Upon arriving on deck, you'll promptly be jumped by three Assault Troopers and a lone Seagull.  The first Trooper is just over to the right and is your main priority, as the cheeky little bugger will attempt to land next to you.  The rest can be picked off at your leisure. Don't leave the Kobayashi Maru just yet, though - strafe to the right to set the Sea Monsters on the sun deck into action.  They won't be able to hit you, and are quite likely to kill themselves.

Head left for both a Super Soak'em and the lift that will take you up to the aforementioned sun deck.  Soaking up the rays and guarding two Single Bananas and a Coconut Launcher is a single Pig Cop.  Return to the main deck and turn your gaze towards the swimming pool.  In the shallow pool at the back are two boxes of Shells.  A further two can be found not too far to the left of it, while you can grab a couple of Clips to the right.

The main pool isn't quite so inviting or rewarding, unless you happen to find four Octabrains and eight Slimer Eggs to be inviting or rewarding.  In terms of stuff, you'll be able to grab some Coconut Launcher Ammo, Pineapples, two boxes of Shells, and a Clip.  If you want to hold back until later, you'll be able to deal with the Octabrains through a viewing window.

Make your way around the outside of the deck and head down the stairs.  I could tell you about the pair of Clips on the railing, but I'd much rather talk about the pair of Pig Cops and the Assault Trooper waiting for you at the bottom. And now I have, and now I'm also telling you one of them is around to the left. Next to that Pig Cop is a box of Pineapples.

There's a choice of paths here, but only the one marked by the sign for dance lessons is of particular worth to us at the moment.  The lift to the right, near the Shells, leads to the bridge, but without the appropriate Cards, you won't be able to do a great deal for the time being.  As you round the corner to the left, there are two Assault Commanders.  The bottle of Hot Sauce here is pretty self-evident, but the Coconut Launcher Ammo tucked away in the corner to the right, not so much.

Make your way around the corner and downstairs, killing off the three Assault Troopers that dwell in the stairwell.  Other than a delightful bit of murder, there are two Single Bananas and a likewise number of Clips to be found there. Hanging around the bottom of the stairs is another pair of Assault Troopers, and bringing up the rear is a Pig Cop.  In this rather small room, you can pocket a Holoduke, a Crate of Bananas, and a two lots of Shells.

If you have a little swim in the fountain, you can find a further two boxes of Shells and a Bunch of Bananas.  Behind the only door out of this area is a Pig Cop - he's not alone, as his friend is hiding just around the corner to the left.  In the connecting area are a couple of Assault Troopers.  Along with a couple of Single Bananas and a Water Pistol, you'll find the viewing window for the pool that I alluded to earlier.

Duke Nukem walks into a bar.  He kills the two Pig Cops and Assault Troopers. That's it, that's the joke.  Down the right wall are two lots of Ice Crusher Ammo, and on the stage is an equal number of Voodoo Ring Ammo.  Behind the bar, for whatever reason, is a Bunch of Bananas.  Behind the door to the left of the stage is a Sea Monster, and around the corner from that is another.  Push the button to call the freight lift, and while you're waiting for it, grab the double dose of Conchanator Ammo from over on the right.

Speaking of immediately being accosted by an Octabrain as soon as you arrive - yeah, that.  As you make your way into the first shadow, a Sentry Drone will swoop down from above.  You're faced with a second Sentry Drone and Octabrain just as you round the corner.  If you need them, you'll find two Bunches of Bananas in the corridor to patch you up.  Heading through the door will bring you out into the engine room.

At either side of the area is a booth that contains a switch.  The switches are pretty cool, but we're ahead of ourselves.  In front of you are two boxes of Shells, and in each of those booths is an Assault Trooper to use them on. You'll also find a Single Banana in each booth, but you don't have to shoot them to death or anything crazy.  Between them, the switches will open the large pipe and remove the grate inside, allowing you access to the rest of the engine room.  Before you get to that, mind you, you might think about diving down and having a little swim.

Down there are two Octabrains and seven Slimer Eggs.  In terms of stuff to put in your pocket, there's only a bottle of Hot Sauce and a pair of Sunglasses. In the room directly below where you came in, you'll see a rather tempting Pearl Health, all on its lonesome.  Of course, it isn't, as approaching it will open the wall behind it, unleashing a further five Octabrains.

Jump into the pipe and follow it to its conclusion.  To get out of the pipe, look for a discoloured panel and give it a quick kick.  If you feel like going swimming in the surrounding pool of water, you can grab yourself two Bunches of Bananas.  Continue ever onward and head through the vent.  To get through the crushers, simply run into them while they're down to get the fastest possible start - just don't get carried away and run into the next one along.  To get close to the second one, you'll have to crouch, as the ceiling gets a little low there.  At the end, head through the vent.

In the vent is a Single Banana, which is pretty exciting if you like bananas. Once the area starts to widen, shoot out the fan and head into the turbine room.  The water is damaging and there's nothing to be found below its surface, so you can save yourself some grief there.  Shoot out the fans at the other side and make your way around to the right - happily, you won't be turned into jam.  At the other side, you'll find a room with a Coconut Launcher, a Pearl Health, some Suntan Lotion, a Crate of Bananas, and the Red Credit Card.

The lift on the left side of the room brings you up in an area with four Slimer Eggs and two boxes of Shells.  The door in here will open out into the passenger quarters, which is nice, because this is exactly where we need to be. Directly behind the door is a Pig Cop, with backup in the form of two Assault Troopers to the left.  If you go poke the vending machine, you'll open the door to the right, revealing [Secret Place 1].  It's incredibly dark, and somebody probably died horribly, but hey, can't turn your nose up at a Conchanator and two boxes of Conchanator Ammo.

As you head back out of the room, know ye that the door on yon right is where you need to go to progress, but hold thy horses.  If you head through the area, you'll find a reception desk over on the right, and behind it two Pig Cops and an equal number of Bunches of Bananas and boxes of Shells.  On the stairs leading back to the deck, you'll find a further two Pig Cops, two Clips, and two Single Bananas.  The stairs will bring you out on deck near the lift to the bridge.  Yeah, you can ignore them entirely.

Head through the door we talked about, then.  There are two Bunches of Bananas and a Pig Cop - decide which one you want to shoot in the face.  If you walk around the corner all guns blazing, it's pretty much suicide, so inch your way out, killing each enemy before they activate.  Start with the Seagull, then move onto the Pig Cop and the pair of Assault Troopers.  The Sea Monsters out on the sun deck can be left until last - the one closest to you will more than likely kill itself in a vain attempt to get at you.

There are two Clips in the corridor, but no-one cares, so pick off the last Assault Trooper through the window and go and explore the deck.  'Explore' may have been overgenerous, as the deck is tiny.  Behind the bar is some Suntan Lotion, and upon the railing are two boxes of Shells.  There's only one other set of doors out of the area, and behind it is a pair of Assault Commanders. There's also a pair of explosive barrels nearby, but they don't really do much other than look pretty when they explode and not kill anything.  Your reward for not dying horribly is a Crate of Bananas and two boxes of Coconut Launcher Ammo.  Call the lift and, well, you know the drill. Boxes, boxes everywhere.  Oh, and two lots of TPS Rounds.  Approach the boxes, and when you reach the junction, quickly back up to avoid the Sentry Drone heading from the left.  Around to the right, you can find a Voodoo Ring, a pair of Sunglasses, and an opportunity to take out some Octabrains from the window. Back around to the left now.  See the Bunch of Bananas to the right?  See the box in front of you?  Groovy - you can use that box to jump over the boxes to the left to find a small area with some Coconut Launcher Ammo.  To get back out, you can just jump.

Continue in the direction you were heading before I distracted you with talk of boxes.  Around the third corner from the Single Banana, you will be assailed by another Sentry Drone.  In the alcove where it was hiding is a switch that will open [Secret Place 2] just to the left of it, where you'll find a Pearl Health. Around the next corner is a third and -- thankfully -- final Sentry Drone. Nearby, you'll be able to jump onto the stack boxes to reach some Pineapples. Waiting for you around the corner are two Assault Commanders.

The inside of that large box constitutes the entirety of [Secret Place 3], and holds an Ice Crusher.  This goes nicely with the two Ice Crusher Ammo just up from the box.  Opposite the Ice Crusher Ammo, you'll see some Shells in the little alcove (near to where you got the Pineapples).  Heading down the little cut to the right of the lift will give you some Conchanator Ammo.  Call the lift (whatever you like, it doesn't have ears) and take a ride.

You know something is wrong when the game starts showering you with items and stuff.  There are two Bunches of Bananas, an equal number of boxes of TPS Rounds, and some Coconut Launcher Ammo.  Just around the corner from all that lot is a box of Pineapples, but you might want to hold off on that for a bit. Also around that corner, though with plenty of breathing room betwixt you and them, is a pair of Mini Battlelords.  The environment favours you heavily, so there's nothing more I can add that you don't already know.

Once they're, you know, dead, be sure not to miss your well-earned Clip in the tunnel behind them.  At the other end of the area, three Octabrains will run interference on your face.  They're accompanied by four Slimer Eggs, but we both know they're not running anywhere.  Two Voodoo Trip Bombs can be found in the corner opposite the lift.  You can hear a Sea Monster flolloping about, but it's far above you, so you're safe for the moment.  There's a good chance that it'll get overexcited and kill itself before you get there, but if it doesn't, you'll find it in the corridor leading from the lift.  Ride that lift, yo.

Look to your right, it's Voodoo Ring Ammo - liberate it.  Around the corner at the red-lit corridor, you'll be ambushed by a Sentry Drone, a second such Drone following closely behind it.  Along the sloped wall at the back are two boxes of Shells.  Down the stairs and around the corner is one final Sentry Drone. As you fully round the corner, the control panel will open and two Assault Commanders will spawn down by the lift, joined by a pair of Pig Cops by the other lift.  To cheer you up, there are two Single Bananas here.

Flip all of the switches to open the panel opposite, revealing the Blue Credit Card.  It also opens up [Secret Place 4] (well, technically, that's the sole responsibility of the second switch from the right).  The opening can be found along the wall with the Shells.  Inside is a lovely Pearl Health.  Head back down the way you came (unless you want to shoot the fan and hurl yourself to the ground) and deal with those Assault Commanders.

Head back to the cargo area and cut an immediate left to find [Secret Place 5], which opened about the same time as the last Secret Place.  Inside is a Coconut Launcher and Coconut Launcher Ammo, along with a Pearl Health (up on the boxes to the right).  On your way out of the cargo hold, you'll encounter three more Pig Cops, two of which are grouped together by the lift.  Right at the top is a newly-spawned Assault Commander.  By the reception desk in the quarters are two more Pig Cops.  Back on deck is an Assault Commander, and all the way over to the right, near the lift to the bridge, is a second one.

Take the lift to the bridge - the lift opens out behind you, straight into a Pig Cop.  In front of the bridge door is some Suntan Lotion, but don't you get ahead of yourself.  To your left is a pair of Pig Cops, and to the right is a Sea Monster.  Ignore the door for a minute and instead focus on the lifts at either side of it - these will take you down to the bow of the ship.

It doesn't particularly matter which lift you take, as you'll be greeted by a Sea Monster at the bottom of each of them.  Bringing up the rear of each one is a Pig Cop, and high above you are three Assault Troopers and a Seagull.  To the left and right of the left and right lifts respectively are two lots of Shells. In the middle of the area are two Clips, and on the vents at the back is a Pearl Health and Pineapples.  Explanation over, turn your attention towards the
bridge again.

While the slope in front of the windows offering up some Suntan Lotion is quite nice, we're really more interested in the windows themselves.  Getting close to the windows will set the Sentry Drones inside into action.  Once they spot you and come over for a nice explode, take them out with an area-of-effect weapon. The way is clear to the bridge proper now, and in it is the exit button and a Crate of Bananas.

      Lost Lagoon                                                    02.06

        Secrets: 3
        Enemies: 85
       Par Time: 5:14
 3D Realms Time: 1:24

Grab the Super Soak'em and Suntan Lotion from your little starting cave and dive into the water.  Out in the lagoon, you'll immediately be greeted by a pair of Sharks.  There are two boxes of Shells on top of the arch, and that's about it for underwater spoils.  The only real reason to stay below the surface is to avoid being attacked from a disadvantageous angle by the Assault Troopers camped along the side of the river.  The canyon opens out towards the back of the area, at which point you'll be jumped by two Octabrains from the left. There's a Bunch of Bananas over to the right, if you're so inclined.

In the cave to the right are three Clips, but they're of far less importance than the six Pig Cops currently rushing towards you.  The cave will bring you up along side the river, giving you a chance to deal with the three Assault Troopers at the other side.  Back at your side, however, you'll find a box of TPS Rounds and two Bunches of Bananas.

Just around to the right of the cave exit is a little ledge, just crying out to be jumped to.  Said ledge will lead to a small cave back on your side that'll offer up a Conchanator.  Despite being a pretty sneaky area, it's not classed as a Secret Place.  Progress, because I know you like progress, can be found behind the large stone column on your side of the river.

Not too far inside the cave is a box of TPS Rounds and a Bunch of Bananas, that you might want to collect.  Just around the corner from them is a quintet of Pig Cops, that you might want to explode.  Instead of immediately putting your adventuring skills to the test and hopping the chasm, have a look over the left side, where you'll notice a tiny ledge - drop down and make your way along for [Secret Place 1].  You won't find anything more than a couple of boxes of Pineapples, mind you.  Throw one of those Pineapples towards the top of the rocky steps to open the exit, which will bring you out not too far from where you dropped down.

Before you hop the chasm, head back to where the Bunch of Bananas were and face back in the direction you came from, then throw a few Pineapples against the wall to the left of the left-hand stalactite.  Across the other side of the chasm, once you hear the telltale sound of a Sea Monster, detonate the Pineapples to save yourself the trouble of dealing with a pair of them. Activate the hand print on the beacon, then quickly return to the other side of the gap to avoid the ensuing explosion.  If you didn't, then all is still well, as there's a Crate of Bananas in the corner near the beacon.

Back outside of the cave, you'll discover two things; firstly, you'll find a pair of Pig Cops waiting in ambush to the right, aided by the Seagull over on the other side of the river; and secondly, you'll find the arch that was previously underwater now forming a makeshift bridge.  If you somehow manage to fall off the arch when making your way across it, I'll automatically think less of you.  Your immediate reward for crossing the river is some Shells and a Bunch of Bananas.  So, right it is.

Ignore the cave for the moment and follow the river to the right.  Don't drop over the waterfall, obviously, or you'll have to make your way back up and across the river.  Diving here will net you some Conchanator Ammo and provide a couple of Sharks to murder.  Head into the cave and make your way around to the left.  Keep an eye to the right as you go, as there's a small alcove with two Octabrains and a Slimer Egg.  Behind the Egg is a Snorkel.

With the Snorkel, you can now reach the bottom of the stupidly deep trench not too far from you.  Continue the way you were heading, and as you approach the corner, dive down.  Near the top of the trench, towards the mesh between this area and the next, are two Sharks.  All the way at the bottom of the trench is another Shark and a Coconut Launcher.

Head into the next area and marvel as the chopper buggers off and leaves you. Oh, and there are seven Assault Troopers waiting for you on the helipad, and should probably be dealt with before you go have a little explore below the waves.  Down there, other than a couple of Sharks, you can find a Holoduke and a Bunch of Bananas.  The switch that operates the lift is on the wall directly below it.

It takes about thirty seconds for the lift to reach its destination, so you've time to scratch yourself inappropriately and contemplate finishing that novel you started.  At the top, you'll be greeted by a couple of Pig Cops.  Sadly for them, the room they're in is full of gas canisters.  They'll shoot them, you'll shoot them, it doesn't really matter - all that matters is that you keep as far back as possible, because they're going boom.  Grab the Coconut Launcher Ammo and head outside.  You have the opportunity to burn your bum and grab two lots of Voodoo Ring Ammo not too far up.

There's some Suntan Lotion in the middle of the area, but it won't help your bum.  Around the corner from the red door to the left are three little Pig Cops jealously guarding a bottle of Hot Sauce - they won't help your bum, either. Head over to the temple and blast a hole in the column under the rocky outcrop. Inside of which is the Blue Credit Card.  The column isn't cracked, so it's not like it would have been immediately obvious, even to your bad self.

To the right of that temple, if you should feel like it, is a cave.  It's a pretty straightforward cave, too, with there being only one route through it. Stick to the left wall religiously and make your way around, jumping up to the next section when required.  When you reach the Sunglasses, you'll notice a faded message on the wall next to them ("DESTROY THE ONE THAT DOES NOT STAND THE SUN"), alluding to the column you just destroyed.

You're not quite alone in this cave, as there's a pair of Slimers flolloping about, though you've probably met them already.  As you made your way around, you'll have seen a small pool over on your right.  At the bottom of it is a box of Coconut Launcher Ammo and a Voodoo Ring.  Other exciting things found in the cave include a Bunch of Bananas and, well, that's it.  Yeah, back to the temple you go.

Grab the Shells to the left of the temple door, then have a little wander inside.  The door will shut behind you, trapping you in the dark with a fiendish and somewhat unreliable scripted event.  The door at the other side of the room is supposed to open and let in an Assault Commander, but it sometimes takes a minute or so for the event to trigger.

Once you're through the door, it'll shut behind you far quicker than it opened. Oh, and the ceiling is coming down to crush you horribly.  To death.  Until you die from it.  There are two ways out of this room, you'll be pleased to know - the second of which being the more profitable choice.  The bars at the opposite end of the room are damaged, presenting you with a slightly smaller than Duke- sized space to squeeze through.  Once the ceiling reaches you, it will push you down far enough to allow you to fit.

The second means of escape is achieved by activating the Battlelord plaques at either side of the room to open an alcove on the left wall (to the left of the plaque).  That small tunnel not only serves as an escape route but also happens to be [Secret Place 2], and offers up a Pearl Health.  Next to the exit door is a Bunch of Bananas for you to ignore.  In the room the door leads to is a beacon that, when activated will destroy the back wall, letting you reach the river.  Enjoying the scenic view along with you are seven Octabrains and six Slimer Eggs.  In regards to items, a Crate of Bananas can be found over on the left.  Hop into the river and go with the flow.

You'll end up sort of back in the cave near the temple.  If you make your way back towards the temple, you'll have a run in with five Pig Cops.  In that area is a Bunch of Bananas, and back by the lift is some Shells.  To progress, you'll want to be where you found the Sunglasses, you know, near the message on the wall.  The back wall is missing, and you can now access the river behind it.  There are five Sea Monsters over to the right, but you can safely poke your head around the corner and explode them.  Over on the rocks is an Ice Crusher.

Hop into the river and jump upstream.  As you round the corner, two Pig Cops will poke their heads out of a little cave to the right.  You more than likely won't have time to kill them before they plodge into the river and get washed away.  If they do, you'll encounter them all the way at the bottom of the area. Inside their cave is some TPS Rounds and Shells.  Continue making your way upstream and jump into the waterfall for [Secret Place 3].  Along with three Slimers, you'll find two Bunches of Bananas and two lots of Conchanator Ammo.

Hurl yourself back into the river, oh already wet one.  After you drop down the first fall, if you push over to the left and do battle with three Octabrains, you can grab three lots of Voodoo Ring Ammo.  If you can't be bothered, you can just keep on keeping on and avoid the fight altogether.  At the bottom, swivel your eyes towards that rocky pillar in the water - behind that is an Assault Commander.  In the water, around that same rocky pillar, you'll find two boxes of TPS Rounds, guarded by Sharks, as always - in this case three of them.

Outside the temple is a box of Conchanator Ammo and a Bunch of Bananas.  If you want to get into the temple, you're first going to have to suffer another timed event.  Once it finally triggers, an Assault Commander will blast a hole in the rock to the left.  Enter the newly-revealed cave and follow it around to reach de plane.  The latter part of the cave is blocked by a half-dozen Slimer Eggs, but it's no big deal.

Over to the left is a box of Coconut Launcher Ammo, and on the left wing of the plane is a Crate of Bananas.  In the water, in amongst the quintet of Sharks, is a bottle of Suntan Lotion.  Surfacing inside the wreckage will see you come across the Red Credit Card.  Back on the surface, four Octabrains will emerge from the tunnel to run interference on your face.  There's a fifth one lagging behind in the tunnel.

In the temple, you'll be ambushed by the final scripted event.  The two Bunches of Bananas here are presumably to give you something to much on while you wait for it to trigger.  When the doors open, you'll have to make a choice in regards to your route.  Each of the three routes lead to the same place, but don't vary greatly in difficulty, though they do each offer a different reward.

The left route is the easiest, with the only source of damage coming from the torches that light the route.  There are jumps to make, but there isn't really any precision involved.  And that's just as well, because falling will see you really rather dead.  The reward for this little jaunt is some Conchanator Ammo and two lots of Voodoo Ring Ammo.  The middle route has no jumps, but it does have a rather nasty stretch of damage panels on the final straight.  Hot Sauce has few uses, but this is one of them.  The reward this time is three boxes of TPS Rounds.

The right path is a mirror of the left path but without the jumps.  As you make your way along, you'll be assaulted from every direction by the same kind of blasts that Octabrains are fond of using.  They're as damaging as you'd expect, but their real danger is in that they carry enough force to knock you off the path.  The reward for your masochism is two boxes of Coconut Launcher Ammo and a deep sense of fulfilment.

The chamber you end up in is, well, pretty bloody massive.  It also presents you with ample opportunities to fall to your death.  The floating platforms are slightly too far apart to reach with a regular jump, so you'll have to rely on strafe jumps to reach the central platform.  As soon as you land on it, a part of the column will slide upwards, revealing a beacon.  Don't activate it just yet, as behind it are two Bunches of Bananas and some Coconut Launcher Ammo.

As a disheartening break from tradition, activating the beacon won't explode anything.  What it does do is open a panel to the left -- revealing two Assault Commanders -- and the exit door to the right, as well as raise the lava to be level with the central platform.

If you still possess the Sandals (spoilers: you should), you can just saunter over to the exit.  If you don't, you'll still be able to make it across in a couple of running jumps, so damage will be minimal at worst.  Out in the fresh air, hop into the river and let it wash your worries away.  Waiting for you at the end is the Kobayashi Maru, the bravest little, exit-carrying, Pearl Health- holding boat in the whole wide world.

 3D Realms Time: 2:57

Directly ahead of you is some Shells, and around the corner to the left are two Assault Troopers and a couple of Clips on the rock.  To make progress, throw a Pineapple into the pool and make it go boom.  As an added bonus, you'll do away with the Octabrain and Slimer waiting for you down there.  If you find yourself short of anything to open the way, you'll have to brave the pool to grab the box of Pineapples.

The tunnel you uncover leads to a similar such pool a little bit further along. By now, you're probably sick of Clips, but there are three in the tunnel if you want them.  The pool I just mentioned comes with a live-in Octabrain and Slimer of its own.  Rather than surface immediately, have a little look along the bottom of the right wall for a small hole - this will lead to [Secret Place 1], which offers up a Single Banana, a box of Pineapples, and a Snorkel.  Return to the large pool and throw a Pineapple out the water and make it do its thing. There were three Assault Troopers waiting in ambush.  There now isn't.

There's still a welcoming party, though, just now a little smaller.  Around the corner is a Pig Cop and a further two Assault Troopers.  Near to them is the almost obligatory Bunch of Bananas and Clips.  The blue door can be found here, so make a little mental note.  Head out of the area the only way you can - by plodging in the river.  To the left are a couple of Slimers and to the right is an Assault Trooper.  Show them some love, then show yourself over to the left.

Back in the sun, you'll find yourself having to deal with two Assault Troopers and a Pig Cop.  As you approach the Shells, the nearby wall will explode, providing a quick way back to the start of the level, should you wish to do something like shoot the lone Assault Trooper that's waiting for you at the
other side.

If you defoliate the tree, you'll uncover the entrance to a small cave, which happens to be [Secret Place 2].  It's quite far up the wall, so you'll have to jump from the rock formation to reach it.  Your reward for being able to jump a short distance with minimal effort is a Coconut Launcher and Coconut Launcher Ammo.  Use your friendly neighbourhood rock formation now to reach the top of the waterfall.  There's an Octabrain, a Pig Cop, and an Assault Trooper waiting for you at the end of the stream.  A box of TPS Rounds and a Single Banana are
also waiting for you.

On the wall to the right is a suspicious bloodied hand print, that when pressed will open [Secret Place 3] just across from it.  Inside of which is a bottle of Suntan Lotion, a Single Banana, and some Coconut Launcher Ammo.  Open the door at the end of the corridor, then quickly close it again.  Behind the statue is a Sea Monster, and dotted around the room is a Pig Cop and a couple of Assault Troopers.  Opening the door tricks them into coming down and being metaphorical fish in a metaphorical barrel.  A Single Banana won't help you in the slightest right now, so you'll find a Single Banana.

Have a little wander up the steps and take a look at the columns at the back of the statue.  Each column has two switches - one at the top, one at the bottom. Once all four switches are activated, a switch will appear behind the statue. Said switch will open the area behind the statue, revealing a Sea Monster, a Bunch of Bananas, and a rather groovy altar.

Stepping up to the altar will see it lower into the ground, presenting the Blue Credit Card.  It'll also spawn a single Assault Trooper back outside the room. Speaking of outside, once you're there, jump up to the waterfall on the right, where you should kill the pair of Octabrains and drop down.  To your left is the red door, guarded very laxly by an Assault Trooper.  You can find two lots of TPS Rounds by the door.

Lurking in the pool is an Octabrain and a Slimer. They're just hanging out with a box of Shells and two Single Bananas.  Below the waterfall is a crack, and behind the crack is a tunnel which leads back to the pool near the blue door, which is convenient, as that's where you need to go.  Behind the blue door is a Pig Cop, and to the right of it is a Sea Monster, an Assault Trooper, and the offering of a Single Banana. To the left are two Clips.

In the room is a Pig Cop and an Assault Trooper, with another two found around the corner to the right.  Up for grabs here is some Coconut Launcher Ammo and a Clip.  Behind the rather groovy stained glass window is a Single Banana and a switch that you'll find to operate the bookcase nearby, revealing [Secret Place 4].  Inside is some Coconut Launcher Ammo, Conchanator Ammo, and a Crate of Bananas.

Around the corner from where you entered are two lots Voodoo Ring Ammo and a Bunch of Bananas.  Oh, and a switch that will open the door on the right (where the Sea Monster was) for a short time.  Immediately behind the door are two Pig Cops and a box of Shells.  Take a little look through the hole in the wall and promptly kill the four Assault Troopers making faces at you.  The switch here will open the door and raise the water level.  There's nothing but a Bunch of Bananas in the pool, so it's safe to skip it and make your way across and up the stairs.

Behind the door you'll find there is a Sea Monster, and in the room off to the right of it is an Assault Trooper and a Pig Cop.  In the centre of that room is a Bunch of Bananas and a total of four Clips.  The Clips are quite important, oddly enough, but we'll get to that in a minute.  Firstly, look up to the left of where the Sea Monster was.  In that alcove, known affectionately as [Secret Place 5] to its friends, is a Single Banana, three loose Pineapples, and a bottle of Hot Sauce.

Back to the circular room, then.  Standing in the middle of the room will see a panel raise to the right of the wooden door, revealing a switch.  Shooting it will reveal another such switch to its right, that will reveal another- Well, you get the idea with that.  Shoot the first switch, then spin around to the right, shooting each switch in turn - just make sure not to shoot the first switch a second time.  Once all four switches have been shot, the wooden door will open, granting you access to the Red Credit Card and the exit out of this room.

Along with the Assault Trooper that would normally be found in the area at the bottom of the stairs, an Octabrain and an additional Assault Trooper will have spawned in.  You can find some TPS Rounds on one of the rocks, which isn't really that exciting.  Underwater is a bit more exciting, though.  Down there, you'll have to contend with two Octabrains, but you can pocket a Single Banana, a box of Coconut Launcher Ammo, and a little something else.

Between the beams is a crack, behind which is [Secret Place 6].  Inside is a Conchanator and two lots of Conchanator Ammo, so that's cool.  Head back to the surface and use the rocks sticking out of the pool to reach the waterfall from much earlier.  From there, take the pool near the blue door and head over to the red door.

Through the door and to the right is a Sea Monster, and behind it is some Coconut Launcher Ammo and a Bunch of Bananas.  As you round the corner, you'll spot a Pig Cop hiding behind the statue, because it's really bad at it. There's an Assault Trooper blocking the doorway, and another outside that can be picked off before it activates.  There are two Assault Commanders outside, but they won't venture inside, making them easier to deal with.  Speaking of venturing outside, the moment you step through the door and onto the bridge, a wall will slide open behind you, revealing a Sea Monster and an Assault Trooper.
 
All the fun stuff is a miles below you, and to get down there, you're going to need to hurl yourself face-first towards the waterfall on the left.  Behind the larger of the two waterfalls is [Secret Place 7].  Along with a cheeky message from one of the developers, you'll find a Pearl Health and the only Jet Pack in the expansion.  To get back up to the bridge, take the lift found opposite you when you exit the waterfall.  At the top, you'll immediately be greeted with a Pearl Health.  The little area it occupies comprises the entirety of [Secret Place 8].  Of course, Secrets 7 and 8 are interchangeable - I just wanted to see if you'd throw yourself off the bridge.

When you get to the end of the bridge, a Pig Cop should poke its head over the wall to the left of the statue.  On the grassed area to the right is an Assault Trooper, along with a box of TPS Rounds and a Bunch of Bananas.  There's also a door, but you can't open it just yet, and when you can, it's a bit pointless, really.  Head past what's left of the Pig Cop, taking the Shells as you go. There's another Pig Cop a little way ahead, accompanied by an Assault Trooper and a pair of Clips.

Around the corner to the left, in the little bunker, you'll just about be able to make out a Sea Monster.  Cool people will roll a Pineapple through the pill slot, but you can just shoot it - either way, it won't spot you.  Entering the bunker will spawn an Assault Trooper just outside, allowing you to kneecap it. The combination to that lock, by the way, is ON ON OFF.  The door it opens is just across from it, and is on a timer, so be quick about heading through it. Of course, there's no penalty for the door closing before you get there, it just means you'll have to go toggle one of the buttons to open it again.

Waiting for you inside are two Assault Troopers and a Sea Monster.  Just around the corner from them, three Assault Troopers are hanging out with a Bunch of Bananas.  Head down the stairs - at the bottom, you'll find an Assault Trooper with an Sea Monster bringing up the rear (ha ha rear).  On the raised bit to the right are a further two Assault Troopers, and to the left is some TPS Rounds.  In the river, leading left, are two Slimers.  They'll probably come to greet you - by which, I mean eat your face.

Upon the raised bit to the right is a switch that will open the almost entirely useless door from earlier, allowing you back outside if you so wish.  Next to the Clip, you'll no doubt notice a ledge.  That ledge can be used to reach another such ledge, which in turn leads to a door masquerading as a discoloured section of the rock, which hides [Secret Place 9].  Inside is a Pearl Health and a Crate of Bananas.

Jump into the river and let it wash you down to the cove.  Waiting for you on the surface are three Assault Troopers and an Assault Commander.  You're pretty much surrounded, so going for a dive is vastly preferable to being shot from most conceivable angles.  Down there, mind you, are two Octabrains and two Slimers.  You can find a box of Coconut Launcher Ammo by the bow of the ship and two boxes of Shells on the deck.

When you feel like braving the surface, you can find a Single Banana around the outside of the pool and a box of TPS Rounds on the ship itself.  The key to the yellow door over there by the Assault Commander is found inside the ship. Dive into the water from the left side and have a look for a hole.  Inside, to the right, is an Octabrain and the combination lock to the captain's quarters. Over to the left are two Slimers, a box of Pineapples, and a Single Banana (behind the crate).

Entering the combination either rightly or wrongly will result in an Octabrain and a Slimer spawning outside of the ship.  It's a one-time deal, so you don't have to worry about spawning an ugly army.  The right combination is ON OFF ON ON.  The captain's room holds another Octabrain, but if you're so inclined, you can shoot it through the window at the back of the ship.  Inside the cabin is the Yellow Credit Card you seek, along with two Single Bananas.

Behind the yellow door is a box of Coconut Launcher Ammo, and just around the corner is an Assault Commander to use it on.  At either side of the room, like you really need me to tell you, is an Assault Trooper.  As you approach the impossible-to-miss wooden construct, it'll open up, presenting you with a platform and a hand print switch.  The latter triggers the former and the former takes you down to the exit.

      The Alien Remains                                              02.08
 -------------------------------------------------------------------

        Secrets: 5
        Enemies: 139
       Par Time: 7:21
 3D Realms Time: 3:28

If you turn your attention to the right, you'll see the wreckage of the Kobayashi Maru slowly come into view.  It was one day away from retirement! Once the lift has reached its destination, you'll be able to console yourself with a Super Soak'em and a box of Shells.  Around the corner, at the foot of the stairs, are three Assault Troopers.  You can only head left from the bottom, so yeah.

Take care of the Sentry Drone all the way at the end of the corridor and have a wander over to the door to grab the two boxes of Shells and the Bunch of Bananas.  The door is locked, naturally, but at either side of it is a small gap.  Through the gap on the right side, you'll be able to see a lone Pig Cop. What's more important, though, is what you can't see - that being a Sea Monster behind the door.  Send something explosive through the gap and save yourself some hassle later.  Around the corner to the left is a second Sentry Drone with a Pig Cop providing support.

When heading down the stairs, keep away from the pipes on the left if you've already got a full quota of Pineapples, as the Pig Cop opposite might just end up hitting the Pineapple sitting on the ledge with the pipes.  The central pipe leads somewhere nice when blasted open, but first focus on the enemies situated around the right of the room - they being a Pig Cop and three Assault Troopers. Three Clips and a Bunch of Bananas can be found here, along with a Snorkel and Sunglasses near the Pineapple.  The large door needs both Credit Cards to open, which you don't have, but it's nice to know where it is.

Blast open the pipe, providing it hasn't already been done for you, and hop inside and follow it outside.  It's bloody dark out, so those Sunglasses will come in handy for once.  If you head along the left wall, you'll find, well, a lot of stuff: two boxes of Coconut Launcher Ammo, an Ice Crusher, Suntan Lotion, a Snorkel, Sunglasses, and a Holoduke (close to the the Kobayashi Maru).  Speaking of the Kobayashi Maru, you can pick off two Assault Troopers and a Sentry Drone through the nearby forcefield, saving yourself some effort later.  You're not alone out here, of course - there are four Octabrains bobbing about.

If you swim up and follow the wall back the way you came, there's a Snorkel, Sunglasses, Pearl Health, another Snorkel, another set of Sunglasses, and four Voodoo Trip Bombs up for grabs.  You're well enough equipped to stay underwater for awhile, but there's nothing left down here, so you know, surface already. There are three Assault Troopers on the rock, but more importantly, there's a Sentry Drone buzzing about close to the surface of the water.  On the rock, you can gather two lots of Ice Crusher Ammo, Sunglasses, a Snorkel, and two boxes of Pineapples.

You might have trouble seeing it in the dark, but there's a switch on the tall rock (face the ramp and look to the right).  This opens the door at the top of said ramp, granting you access to [Secret Place 1].  Inside, around the back of the wall, is an Octabrain duo and a Slimer Egg quartet.  In way of recompense for the ugly surprise, you'll also find a Pearl Health and a Coconut Launcher. If you're a fan of Clips, there are two around the outside of the room.  Return to the pipe and head back inside.

Head up the stairs near the large door and prepare for a surprise Sentry Drone attack (well, expected attack, because I just told you).  The room at the top of the stairs is pretty dark, but be assured that there are two Pig Cops and an Assault Trooper inside.  The light switch is on the left wall, near to where the Red Credit Card is sitting.  A Triple Poison Shooter, TPS Rounds, and three Bunches of Bananas can be had here.  The switch on the back wall will open the door from earlier, which is something you'll be wanting to do.  Guess where you need to go now.

Around the corner are two Assault Troopers and an equal amount of boxes of Shells.  If you're running low on health, a Bunch of Bananas can be found behind the door.  At your end of the corridor are a couple of Clips and a Conchanator, while at the opposite end are three Assault Troopers.  In between the machinery running down the left side is a pair of Sentry Drones, but they aren't going to come out until you get within range or you dislodge them with an explosive.  In amongst, and on top of, that machinery are two lots of TPS Rounds, and a likewise number of boxes of Conchanator Ammo.

Head through the door at the end of the corridor and deal with the two Assault Troopers around to the left.  Just to the left of them are two boxes of Shells. On the stairs in front of you are three Clips, and a Pig Cop waiting in ambush. The wall all the way over to the left can be destroyed to reveal a Pearl Health and provide another way to access the corridor you just came from.  If you find yourself without the means to that end, a Pineapple can be found in front of the crack.  When it comes to grabbing the Pearl Health, be wary of the Assault Trooper on the stairs behind you.

If you need a small boost to make grabbing the Pearl Health worth it, there's a Bunch of Bananas on the stairs near the Assault Trooper.  Head up those stairs and deliver the Pig Cop from life, then ride the lift to the left.  Between the exit to the lift and the top of the first flight of stairs, you will encounter two Assault Troopers and two Pig Cops.  Oh, and it's incredibly dark here.

In the area at the top of the stairs, by the window, are two Mini Battlelords - you can't exactly miss them.  At the top of the stairs, like it'll help, is a box of Shells.  Once you get up there, though, the lights will come on (the switch by the security monitor will turn them off again).  Around the corner to the right lurks two Sentry Drones.  In terms of goodies, you can grab an Ice Crusher, two lots of Ice Crusher Ammo, and a Crate of Bananas here.

The switches on the left wall activate those funny-looking paddles outside the window.  They're pretty and they're twirly and they're supposed to show you how to solve a combination puzzle a little way ahead.  It's slightly more complex than pretty and twirly, but we'll get to that in a minute.  Head the way of the Sentry Drones and round the corner, taking note of the box of Pineapples at the bottom of the stairs.  Around that corner are three Assault Troopers, backed up by the Sentry Drone that should be on its way down the stairs right about now. To their right are two boxes of Shells, and on the stairs are two Single Bananas.

In the corner to the right of the Shells, you'll see a little gap with a switch next to it.  The switch will turn on the shrinker behind you.  Getting yourself shrunk and heading through the gap will see you discover [Secret Place 2]. The immediate reward for finding it are two Single Bananas, but it gets better, which is good, because it couldn't have much gotten worse.  Around the corner are two boxes of Coconut Launcher Ammo and a Bunch of Bananas.  The pipe can be blasted open to reveal a Pearl Health.  Trigger the switch next to the shutter to open the way out (back to the Credit Card room), but refrain from throwing yourself out the window just yet.  Go dive into the pool.

Pressing the little red arrow will open a panel to the left, revealing a switch that will open a second panel behind you.  The immediate pay-off is a pair of Sunglasses, which is fine and dandy, as the next bit is decidedly dark. As soon as you surface inside the hive, you'll be confronted by four Octabrains and a whopping fifteen Slimer Eggs.  The adjoining chamber holds two boxes of Coconut Launcher Ammo, a Crate of Bananas, TPS Rounds, and a bottle of Suntan Lotion.  Despite this secret area being far more secret than the secret area it's secreted away in, it doesn't count as a secret.  Head back out and return to where the shrinker is and make your way up the stairs.

The switches here work in a slightly different fashion to what they do in other levels.  There is no exact combination that you need to push in order to unlock something -- that can be achieved simply by pushing all the buttons with your face -- but there *is* a combination that will see you unlock said something with some bonuses and no fuss.  There are nine buttons, and we're doing things from the left, as always.

If you just want to get on with things, the buttons you need to press are 2, 6, and 7.  As well as opening the shield around the Blue Credit Card, this opens a panel to the left of the Bunch of Bananas (to your left).  Inside is a Coconut Launcher and a Pearl Health.  It also has the unwanted side-effect of spawning an Assault Commander and several Sea Monsters, along with a few Pig Cops and Sentry Drones elsewhere in the level.  They're not an imminent threat, so on with the buttons.

Button 1 will drop a box of Coconut Launcher Ammo behind you; buttons 3, 4, 8, and 9 will spawn a Sea Monster near the Clips; and button 5 will drop a Pearl Health in the same place.  An Assault Commander and an Sea Monster can be found at the top of the stairs in the room where you duffed up the Mini Battlelords. A second Sea Monster can be found in the lift you arrived in.

Exit the lift and head down the stairs to the right.  Out in the corridor (use the hole in the wall as opposed to the door), you'll find a newly-spawned Pig Cop, Sea Monster, and Sentry Drone.  I'm down with heading down.  At the bottom of both set of stairs is a Sea Monster.  Actually, that's a lie, as you'll find two down the right side, on account of an extra one spawning due to your recent button-pushing.  Both sets of stairs meet in the middle, so unless you want the Bunch of Bananas down the right side, it doesn't matter which one you take.

There's a box of Shells to be had from the bottom of both sets, but I imagine you'll want to deal with the Pig Cop and Sea Monster that's trying to kill you first.  It won't help much, but there's a Bunch of Bananas at the foot of the next set of stairs.  Left is the only way you can go, obviously, right into the path of an Assault Trooper and Assault Commander.  Because the game is fond of bananas, there's a Bunch of Bananas on the crates behind them.  In the corner to the right of it are two lots of Ice Crusher Ammo.  For the sake of completion, two Clips can be found around the side of the crates on the left wall.

Hopping into the crate next to the Clips will reward you with a Conchanator. It'll also see you find a button that will raise the crates next to the Bunch of Bananas, uncovering a second button that will lower the crate next to this one, revealing [Secret Place 3].  Inside, you'll find Sandals and two lots of Voodoo Ring Ammo.

That high-speed walkway looks fun, doesn't it?  What's more fun is throwing a Pineapple on it and killing the Assault Trooper waiting at the other end. You won't be able to get the Pig Cop hiding over on the left, but hey.  If you took the opportunity much earlier to take out the Assault Troopers and Sentry Drone while you were underwater, the room will already be clear, which is nice. Along with three lots of Conchanator Ammo, you'll find a button that will open the shutter across from the bottom of the walkway.

A quick look at the security monitor will tell you that an Assault Trooper and a Pig Cop were hiding behind it.  There are also two Single Bananas there, but they probably weren't trying to hide.  Buttons!  Like last time, there are nine buttons.  Like last time, it doesn't really matter what order you push them in. Like last time, bad stuff might happen.

If you want to get straight on with things, buttons 3, 6, and 8 will unlock the Red Credit Card.  Because things are never straightforward, this will spawn an Assault Commander out in the corridor near the stairwell, another outside the Card door, and three Assault Troopers in the room with the Credit Cards.  As a small bonus, any of those buttons will open the panel to your right, giving up a Pearl Health and a Voodoo Ring.

Buttons 1, 5, and 7 will spawn two Sea Monsters behind you, one at either side. Button 2 will spawn a Sea Monster behind you and to the right, while button 4 will spawn one on the left, but will also drop a Pearl Health right behind you. Button 3 quite likes you, and will drop a Pearl Health in the same place as the other one.  Button 9 will drop two lots of Coconut Launcher Ammo behind you and spawn two Sea Monsters in the usual place.

Wander on down to the Card room and pocket the Cards, then open the door, well, half of it.  Behind it are two Octabrains, so you'd be best off leaving it half open until you've picked them off.  There's another Octabrain at each side of the door, but you won't be able to reach them without an area-of-effect weapon, of which you should have a few.  There's some Coconut Launcher Ammo behind the door as well.

At either side of the proceeding room, you can grab a box of Conchanator Ammo. Next to the one on the left is a button that will open a door to a teleporter - it leads back to the start of the level, which is, like, a whole fifty feet away.  The large, ominous-looking door is where you need to head.  Before that, mind you, spin on your heels and open the panel opposite for [Secret Place 4]. Inside is a Coconut Launcher, which isn't very exciting until you realise that opening the wall behind it will take you to the much larger [Secret Place 5].

At either side of you is a button that will open the teleporter next to it - it doesn't matter which you take, as they both lead to the same place.  On the central walkway are two boxes of Shells, two Bunches of Bananas, a Coconut Launcher, and two boxes of Conchanator Ammo.  Over on the pipes to the side of the walkway, amidst the lava, is some Hot Sauce and Suntan Lotion.

Make your way out and head through that large, ugly door.  Between here and the next such door, you'll find three lots of Conchanator Ammo.  Despite hearing the sound of a Sentry Drone, you won't actually encounter one, because reasons. When the reactor opens, feel free to hop inside and grab the Conchanator and the pair of Pearl Healths.  The floor is damaging, but you have magic Sandals, so go team.  The door behind it, opened by way of the switch on the wall opposite, leads to the boss.  There's one final Crate of Bananas in front of it, but you already know that.

 ______________________
/BOSS - CYCLOID EMPEROR\_______________________________________________________

 You might think the boss is hiding behind the large column in the middle of the room.  Yeah, he's not.  Approaching it will see it open to reveal nothing but a funky gravity-defying beach ball.  As you cross the lava and get closer still, the doors will seal and the Emperor and two Sea Monsters will spawn in behind you.

 The columns at either side of the room will lower also, offering up a plethora of goodies.  The one on the right side offers a Coconut Launcher and two lot of Coconut Launcher Ammo, and a Conchanator and two lots of Conchanator Ammo. Over on the left are two Single Bananas, two Bunches of Bananas, two Pearl Healths, a Crate of Bananas, and some Suntan Lotion.

 If combated from a distance, the Emperor will primarily stick with sending volleys of coconuts, while at medium range, it'll rely on its psychic blasts. Coconuts are fired randomly, so there's no particular method of dodging them reliably - you just have to keep your eyes open and stay back.  You want a good long distance between you, but you also don't want to be too close to the wall, otherwise you're going to eat a lot of splash damage.  Its intention to fire coconuts is foreshadowed by it extending its arm, while its intention to use psychic blasts is foreshadowed by it lowering its head.

 The psychic blasts are much harder to avoid, with them travelling much closer together, and only really spacing out towards the end of the room.  It's quite possible to back-peddle and strafe as soon as an opening is available, but usually, you'll just be minimising the number of blasts you get hit by. If you happen to be mental enough to get closer than that, you'll soon find that the Emperor is capable of bursts of considerable speed.  If it should get close enough to you, it'll stomp you flat.

 Using anything lower than the Coconut Launcher is going to drag the fight out forever, and you've no reason to conserve ammo at this point.  The Coconut Launcher can score you victory in 30 hits, while the Conchanator will require 80 hits, but will obviously land them in far less time.  Being the Big Bad, the Cycloid Emperor is immune to both the Voodoo Ring and the freezing effect of the Ice Crusher.

 The arena inhibits its movement somewhat, with it being unable to traverse the plinths with the items or the sunken area at the far end of the room. The Emperor is also far too big to squeeze its way between the wall and the lights at either side of the area, making it the perfect place to hide. From there, you can bait attacks and retaliate without much of a worry.

      Weapons                                                        03.00
 ==============================================================================

 === Mighty Foot ===

       Damage: 10 (40 with Hot Sauce) [melee]
        Speed: Average
     Capacity: N/A
 Collect Ammo: N/A
  Collect New: N/A

A kick.  In the face.  It's far less effective than it is crude, but it's not without its uses.  Because it's bound to its own key, you can use it while holding another weapon.  You're obviously not going to be using it on an enemy above a Protozoid Slimer or a struggling Assault Trooper, but it serves more than adequately for breaking objects or opening vents without the need to keep changing weapons.  As a sort of added bonus, kicks delivered while under the effects of Hot Sauce will deal four times the damage.


 === Water Pistol (Pistol) ===

       Damage: 6 [hitscan]
        Speed: Fast
     Capacity: 200
 Collect Ammo: 12
  Collect New: 48

The Water Pistol's big selling points are the fact that ammo is so readily available for it and that it has impressive accuracy at range.  It's ideal for situations when you don't want to expend your better ammo, or for when an enemy is out of range of your stronger weapons.  In terms of actual performance, it isn't going to be worrying anything more durable than an Assault Trooper, but that's okay, as you'll mostly be using it to break objects or open vents that are out of range of the Mighty Boot.


 === Super Soak'em (Shotgun) ===

       Damage: 10 x 7 [hitscan]
        Speed: Slow
     Capacity: 50
 Collect Ammo: 10
  Collect New: 10

The Super Soak'em is probably something you should get used to looking at, as you'll be using it for majority of the game.  Ammo is readily available, aiming it isn't a particular concern, and it's strong enough to drop anything below a Mini Battlelord without much effort.  The only drawback to it is the spread pattern of the pellets, which limits its effective range considerably.

 === Triple Poison Shooter (Chaingun/Ripper) ===

       Damage: 9 [hitscan]
        Speed: Very Fast
     Capacity: 200
 Collect Ammo: 50
  Collect New: 50

The Triple Poison Shooter is a fundamentally great weapon that's only really held back by the limited availability of ammo.  Each shot only deals three more damage than the Water Pistol, but its rate-of-fire is immense, allowing it to even deal with, if need be, a Mini Battlelord.  Of course, that would be a monstrous waste of ammo, but it's still possible.  Anything smaller than a Mini Battlelord will be frequently staggered and have little chance of retaliating.  It's particularly good at crowd-control, well, providing it's at mid-range, as it loses accuracy very quickly over almost any kind of distance.


 === Coconut Launcher (RPG) ===

       Damage: 240 (direct hit) [projectile, explosive]
        Speed: Slow
 Blast Radius: Large (1780)
     Capacity: 50
 Collect Ammo: 5
  Collect New: 5

The Coconut Launcher boasts the distinction of being the highest damage single hit weapon in the game; that's providing, of course, you're able to score a direct hit.  If you can't, then the damage is halved, bringing it down to being slightly less powerful than a Pineapple.  It has good accuracy at range, but the projectile travels slow enough to make it pretty much impossible to hit anything that can see it coming.  Against fast enemies or other players, you'll have to rely more on splash damage than direct hits.  For such a powerful weapon, ammo availability is surprisingly plentiful.


 === Voodoo Ring (Shrinker) ===

       Damage: 0 [projectile, shrink effect]
        Speed: Slow
 Blast Radius: Small (680)
     Capacity: 50
 Collect Ammo: 5
  Collect New: 10

     Upon being struck, your target will shrink down to action-figure size.
While they're miniaturised, they won't be able to attack, and will move at
half speed, rendering them vulnerable to being stepped on (which will obviously
prove fatal).  Enemies will remain miniaturised for ten seconds, so despite its
accuracy at range, the Voodoo Ring is best employed within walking distance of
your intended target.

If you fire at a mirror, the shot will bounce back and shrink you, which is
funny and not at all practical.  If you've suffered some shrinkage (there's a
joke in there somewhere), downing some Hot Sauce will instantly return you to
full size and provide immunity to shrinking for the duration of its effect.

The only enemies immune to being shrunk are Sentry Drones and the Cycloid
Emperor.  Protozoid Slimers aren't affected by the Voodoo Ring as such, but it
will kill them, despite dealing no damage.  Mini Battlelords can be shrunk by
turning off all aim-assists and shooting them in the feet, though I suspect
that was never intended.  If you stagger an enemy while they're shrinking, it
will sometimes halt the process and leave them smaller than normal but too
large to be trodden on.  Enemies in this state can still attack, but will
never again be taken seriously by their colleagues.


 === Pineapple (Pipebomb) ===

       Damage: 140 [thrown, explosive]
        Speed: Slow
 Blast Radius: Large (2500)
     Capacity: 50
 Collect Ammo: 5
  Collect New: 1

     Pressing the fire button once will throw a Pineapple, while pressing it a
second time will detonate it.  The longer you hold the fire button, the further
your throw will be, and the more bounce the Pineapple will have when it hits
the ground.  Pineapples travel in an arc, so aiming up slightly will produce a
longer throw.  If you throw a Pineapple while crouching, you'll simply roll it
a very small way along the ground, which can be pretty useful depending on the
situation.  Because throwing a Pineapple automatically equips the detonator,
you'll have to reselect them if you want to throw more than one.

While we all know that it's possible to prematurely detonate Pineapples by
using another explosives, you might not know that a single bullet will also do
the job.  Pineapples make poor direct weapons due to their slow speed and high
potential to blow your face off when chucked around with gay abandon, but excel
as ambush weapons, be they dropped into water, bounced around a corner, or
thrown into a teleporter.


 === Conchanator (Devastator)  ===

       Damage: 38 x 2 [projectile, explosive]
        Speed: Fast
 Blast Radius: Tiny (445)
     Capacity: 99 (consumes 2 ammo per shot)
 Collect Ammo: 15
  Collect New: 15

     The Conchanator is undoubtedly the strongest weapon in the game, so both
its and its ammo's rarity should come as no surprise to you.  Its uses are
rather limited, however, as the only thing it has going for it is its stopping
power, of which it has a truck-load.  Its low capacity, the aforementioned ammo
availability, poor accuracy at range, tiny blast radius, and high rate-of-fire
limits it almost entirely to dealing with the Cycloid Emperor.  For every other
situation that you'd find it useful in, such as crowd control and dealing with
Mini Battlelords, there exists a more appropriate, more sustainable weapon.


 === Voodoo Trip Bomb (Laser Trip Bomb) ===

       Damage: 100 (direct hit) [explosive]
        Speed: N/A
 Blast Radius: Very Large (3880)
     Capacity: 10
 Collect Ammo: N/A
  Collect New: 1

     When a Trip Bomb is set upon a solid surface, it'll arm itself pending a
two second delay.  An armed Trip Bomb will project a line across to the wall
opposite, regardless of how far away that wall happens to be.  When the line is
broken, be it by you, an enemy, or something such as a door, the Trip Bomb will
detonate.  Set Trip Bombs can't be deactivated, but they can be prematurely
detonated with explosives.


 === Ice Crusher (Freezethrower) ===

       Damage: 20 (-50% damage per bounce) [projectile, freeze effect]
        Speed: Fast
     Capacity: 99
 Collect Ammo: 25
  Collect New: 25

     If you would reduce your target's life to zero with this weapon, they'll
be frozen.  Frozen enemies have one hit-point, and will shatter upon being hit.
Enemies will remain frozen for five seconds, but will begin to visibly thaw
after four, meaning you're probably far better off just shooting them with the
Water Pistol than you are trying to get close enough to kick them.  Shots can
ricochet off surfaces, but will do so no more than three times.  And yes, it's
quite possible for you to inadvertently freeze yourself, but worry not, as
enemies won't actively try to shatter you.  They'll just wait until you thaw,
then shoot you in the face.


 ==============================================================================
      Items                                                          04.00
 ==============================================================================

     While it's pretty easy to work out what the non-inventory items do, I feel
that it's probably worth a few lines just to make sure we're on the same page.
With the exception of ammo, every collectable except one is a health item.
Single Bananas (Small Medikit) and Bunches of Bananas (Large Medikit) will
restore 10 and 30 health respectively (up to a maximum of 100), while a Pearl
Health (Atomic Health) will give you 50 health (and can raise your health to a
maximum of 200).

Suntan Lotion (Body Armor) you find laying about will give you 100 points of
armour (the maximum), but the Used variant dropped by Pig Cops will only give
50-75 points of armour.  Damage received is partly deducted from your armour
points, decreasing damage by up to 50% (with the minimum being 20%).


 === Crate of Bananas (Portable Medikit) ===

 Duration: N/A
   Hotkey: M
   Toggle: N/A

     Each percent of the Crate of Banana's capacity represents 1 point of
health.  Using the item will restore your health up to a maximum of 100,
while decreasing the capacity of the item by an equal amount.  For being
such a great item, it's quite common, so it's more than possible you'll come
across a fresh one while you still have some of your last one left.  If you
collect that new one, your old one will be discarded.  While the same rings
true with all inventory items that have a use percentage, I'm mentioning
this here because it's the only item in the expansion where it matters.


 === Holoduke ===

 Duration: 92 seconds
   Hotkey: H
   Toggle: Yes

     When used, a holographic projection of Duke will be deployed in front of
you.  The direction it faces, and the pose it takes, is dependent on the
direction you were facing and what you were doing at the time it was deployed
(such as swimming).  While it does have some merit as a distraction in certain,
very specific, circumstances, it isn't of much use.  Those circumstances being
along the lines of forcing enemies to activate from around a corner, where you
can lure them into a trap.  Of course, enemies will only fall for the ploy if
they haven't already spotted you.

Against players, however, yeah, still not much use, as it doesn't have a shadow
or a reflection, which can be a pretty big give away depending on the location
it's deployed in.  The Holoduke is affected by gravity, so there is some use to
be had in deploying it from above a player to force them to react to a moving
(albeit briefly) target.


 === Hot Sauce (Steroids) ===

 Duration: 15 seconds
   Hotkey: R
   Toggle: No

     For its duration, Duke will move at several times normal speed, will be
immune to being shrunk (and reverse the effect if you already have been), and
will increase his kick damage by a factor of four.  Outside of multiplayer, the
immunity to being shrink is almost of no use, as the only enemy in the game
that can fire shrink rays doesn't appear in this expansion, and the few times a
shrinker does come into play, you pretty much want to be shrunk.

The movement bonus is pretty ridiculous, though.  You can fire a projectile,
wait a second, and then chase after it and hit yourself.  That's how big the
speed boost is.  If you're running forward at the time, you will immediately
hit yourself (which is funny).  Actually hitting something when moving at that
speed isn't particularly easy, so it's best kept for a quick escape or to speed
up your progress through a level.


 === Jet Pack ===

 Duration: 61 seconds
   Hotkey: J
   Toggle: Yes

     For a start, I suppose it's pretty important for me to point out that only
one Jet Pack appears in this expansion, and that it's one level before the end.
Understandably, this renders it almost entirely useless outside of multiplayer.
While the Jet Pack is active, crouch and jump will control your descent and
ascent respectively.  If you're a little too high and your fuel is a little too
low, don't forget you can just free-fall and activate the Jet Pack before you
hit the ground.


 === Snorkel (Scuba Gear) ===

 Duration: 246 seconds
   Hotkey: N/A
   Toggle: Automatic

     You won't find a great many of them on your travels, but that really
doesn't matter, as the Snorkel has the longest duration of any item, coming in
at just over four minutes.  To add to this, if you're going to need to do a lot
of swimming in a level, that's usually the exact point when one will turn up.
The Snorkel automatically engages as soon as you enter the water, and shuts
itself off as soon as you get out.


 === Protective Sandals (Protective Boots) ===

 Duration: 25 seconds (lava)/50 seconds (slime/acid)
   Hotkey: N/A
   Toggle: Automatic

     Protective Sandals serve as a barrier between you and damaging surfaces. In this expansion, those surfaces are namely lava and slime/acid.  Outside of the expansion, there exists purple lava, which is far more damaging and reduces the active duration down to just 8 seconds.  Slime appears very rarely in this expansion, with lava being reasonably common.  Like the Snorkel, the Sandals will activate and deactivate as and when required.


 === Sunglasses (Night Vision Goggles) ===

 Duration: 46 seconds
   Hotkey: N
   Toggle: Yes

     Sunglasses aren't particularly good at illuminating low light areas, which is kind of disappointing when you consider that's exactly what they're supposed to do.  I will say, however, that they're extremely good at highlighting enemies in the dark.  So while you might not always be able to navigate the environment too effectively, nothing will be able to jump out and get you.  As far as this expansion goes, there aren't really all that many areas where they're needed.

 ==============================================================================

 === Assault Trooper ===

 Health: 30
  Speed: Slow/Average [ground/flying]
 Damage: Blaster: 7 [projectile]

  Drops: Water Pistol Clip

This might be a wee bit confusing, but bear with me.  Normally, you have Assault Troopers and Assault Captains.  Assault Captains are, physically, just palette-swapped Assault Troopers, but they have twice the health and carry with them a cloaking device.  There are no Assault Captains in this expansion, due to some of their code being recycled for something else, however, the rest of that code was seemingly handed down to the Troopers, as some of them have the ability to cloak.

While their attack is somewhat slow and easy to strafe, it does have a degree of variation.  While they're kneeling, their attack speed increases by an imperceptible amount (we're talking something like an increase of 0.2, so it's not like you'll notice it), and while they're flying, it's almost halved.

Their speed also varies, though far more noticeably.  While their running speed is only fractionally higher than their walking speed, their flying speed is roughly two-and-a-half times faster.  Speaking of flying – Assault Troopers will rarely activate their Jet Pack if you're not using yours, are higher than them, or are far away from them.  While their travelling speed is impressive, their ascent and descent speed leaves them vulnerable.

When an Assault Trooper is killed in a way that would leave a body (i.e. no shrinking, freezing, or exploding), there's a rather exact 12.5% chance that they'll drop to their knees and throw out some amateur dramatics before they die.  If you don't hit them again while this animation is playing out, there's a 25% chance that they'll get back up in a short while with full health. If you're really that concerned, you'll want to make sure you leave no bodies.

Assault Troopers equipped with the cloaking device will activate it immediately upon spotting you.  Cloaked enemies cannot harm you, nor can they be harmed. Cloaked Troopers are very fond of reappearing behind you when you're least expecting it.  They're not going to follow you the length and breadth of the map or anything, and the cloak duration is limited, so they don't pose anything more than a minor nuisance.


 === Assault Commander ===

 Health: 350
  Speed: Slow [flying]
 Damage: Spin: 11 [melee]
         Coconut: 35 [projectile, explosive]

  Drops: N/A

     At a distance, Assault Commanders will be quite content to very slowly
fire explosive coconuts at you (the precursor to which is them very noticeably
tilting backwards).  They won't really make much of an effort to close the
distance against you, and that's just fine, as they're nothing more than a
glorified damage sponge over there.  If they do get close, they'll spin their
flight deck in your face, dealing pretty decent damage.  Of course, they
actually have to get close, which they won't unless you feel like letting them.

Giving up any chance of being formidable, active Assault Commanders will alert
you to their presence via their late-night-telephone-call breathing.  While the
Super Soak'em or higher can do a good enough job against them, using anything
other than the Voodoo Ring is a waste of ammo.


 === Beach Babe ===

 Health: 30
  Speed: Slow/Fast [ground]
 Damage: N/A

  Drops: N/A

     Beach Babes are what you get when someone attempts to add NPCs to a game
that can't really support them.  As such, Beach Babes are enemies -- and are
counted as such on the end-of-level screen -- with neither the means nor the
inclination to do you harm.  Until they're attacked, they'll quite happily
potter about, following Duke around and uttering playful dialogue.  Upon being
struck, they'll pick up the pace and attempt to put distance between themselves
and their attacker.  The sight of enemies and other generally unpleasant things
have no effect on them.


 === Inflatable Sea Monster ===

 Health: 50
  Speed: Slow [ground]
 Damage: Coconut: 35 [projectile, explosive]

  Drops: N/A

     While it's essentially a Pig Cop wearing a rubber ring fashioned into the
shape of a sea monster, the Pig Cop itself makes no discernible difference in
regards to hit-points, and isn't ejected like it would be with other modes of
transport, after the rubber ring is destroyed.  Inflatable Sea Monsters are
incredibly slow, very keen to announce their presence by making a loud bouncing
sound (when active), and rank amongst the weakest of enemies, physically
speaking.  They make up for this, however, by being able to fire explosive
coconuts at a rather alarming rate.

The Super Soak'em is ideal for short-to-medium range combat, while the Water
Pistol or Triple Poison Shooter will serve you well at range.  Inflatable Sea
Monsters very seldom appear completely without warning, and can often be seen
sticking out slightly from around a corner, making them ideal targets for a
pre-emptive Pineapple.


 === Octabrain ===

 Health: 175
  Speed: Slow [flying]
 Damage: Bite: 11 [melee]
         Psychic Blast: 38 [projectile]

  Drops: N/A

     Octabrains hover about very slowly, shooting balls of psychic energy at
you.  They hit slightly harder than the coconuts fired by Assault Commanders,
but travel almost half as fast.  On top of the attack already being pretty
slow, it needs to be charged before use, something that is visibly noticeable.
If the Octabrain is staggered while charging, the charge progress won't be
reset, and will carry on where it left off once the stagger ends.  Up close,
the big floaty brain will resort to biting you quite badly.

Octabrains usually travel in pairs, but it isn't unusual to see three or more
together.  They're also really good babysitters, and are found near any
sizeable cache of Protozoid Slimer Eggs.  What separates the Octabrain from
most other enemies is that it's quite at home underwater where, you know, your
decreased level of movement and vision (on top of the additional angles you can
be attacked from) make you a much easier target.

In a one-on-one, in an open environment, the Super Soak'em isn't a bad choice
of weapon, with it taking no more than four shots for a kill.  When multiple
Octabrains are involved or space is at a premium, you're best off employing the
Coconut Launcher or the Voodoo Ring, because you really don't want things to
drag on longer than the second or so it takes for them to charge their attack.


 === Pig Cop ===

 Health: 100
  Speed: Slow [ground]
 Damage: Super Soak'em: 10 x 5 (standing), 10 x 3 (crouching) [hitscan]

  Drops: Super Soak'em (1-4 ammo), Used Suntan Lotion (50-75 armour points)

     When you take away their fancy vehicles, Pig Cops are really pretty simple
enemies.  They're slow-moving sacks of pork with a Super Soak'em and a decent
amount of health.  Said Super Soak'em is essentially the same as the one that
you use, but the number of pellets it fires are reduced from 7 to 5, giving it
lower damage overall.  This is, however, mitigated by them firing twice in
quick succession.

The one interesting thing about them is that they can go prone.  Pig Cops
sometimes start out prone so that they're hidden behind something, or they'll
randomly drop to the ground during combat, which can sometimes throw off your
aim (providing you have all forms of aim-assist turned off).  While a Pig Cop
is on the ground, it'll do less damage -- I imagine it being due to the ground
eating some of the pellets -- but will be slightly harder to hit.  Pig Cops
will stop being alive after two decent Super Soak'em blasts, but the Triple
Poison Shooter is a pretty good alternative.

At a whopping two items, Pig Cops have the largest drop pool of all enemies.
While that is obviously a massively exciting fact, what's more exciting is that
they don't actually have to be dead to drop them.  If you freeze a Pig Cop,
they still have the same chance of dropping an item, so you can isolate one and
keep turning it into a novelty ice cube until you max your ammo and armour.


 === Protozoid Slimer ===

 Health: 1
  Speed: Slow [ground]
 Damage: Bite: 5-8 [melee]

  Drops: N/A

     Protozoid Slimers are slightly more mobile than most enemies, being able
to move between floor and ceiling effortlessly.  In rooms with high, dark
ceilings, of which there aren't a great many in this expansion, they are
especially hard to keep track of.  I'm not saying this makes them particularly
dangerous, it doesn't – I'm just saying they're quite good at hide-and-seek.
If you're underwater, they'll actually cling to the underside of the surface.

If they should get close enough to attack, they'll latch onto your face and
completely obscure your vision, which isn't too dangerous providing you're not
toting something with splash damage.  Protozoid Slimers are incredibly weak,
and possess only a single hit-point.  Regardless of their health, though, they
are set to die after a single hit, so even the Voodoo Ring will suffice.
Of course, while you can do that, you'd be silly for using anything other than
the Mighty Foot.  Occasionally, upon death, a Protozoid Slimer will leave a
small puddle of slime behind, which will damage you if stepped in (unless you
have Protective Sandals on).

A Protozoid Slimer's favourite food is face.  In fact, they like it so much
that they don't care what that face belongs to.  If an enemy isn't mechanical
or another Slimer, and is ranked lower than a Mini Battlelord, a Slimer will
attack and consume them.  If they can't wrap their cake-hole around something
living, they will quite happily go chew on a corpse, which can be somewhat
helpful on Tsunami, where an enemy will respawn if their corpse remains.


 === Protozoid Slimer Egg ===

 Health: 20
  Speed: N/A
 Damage: N/A

  Drops: N/A

     Eggs don't really do much, you know, on account of being eggs.  The only
purpose they serve, and indeed their only form of offence, if you could even
call it that, is to spawn a single Protozoid Slimer.  While Eggs are weak to
every weapon, they often come in groups, so an explosive or two to stop them
all hatching and being a nuisance couldn't really be considered a waste.

If you freeze or shrink an Egg that's already hatched, it will revert to its
previous state once the effect expires, allowing it to hatch another Protozoid
Slimer.  Despite being nothing more than glorified props, Eggs still count as
enemies on the end-of-level screen.


 === Seagull ===

 Health: 20
  Speed: Fast [flying]
 Damage: Poop: 1 [projectile]

  Drops: N/A

     Seagulls, as you can tell from their damage output and the fact that they
happen to be small marine birds, barely qualify as a threat.  Mind you, they
were never meant to be one, just a very fast nuisance – something to distract
you, pester you, and generally make you waste time and ammo on hunting them.
They're tiny, and usually far above you, so it can often be hard to track them,
due to the silly places they can get themselves stuck.  They're ignorable, but
if you're aiming for one, the Super Soak'em is a sure bet.


 === Sentry Drone ===

 Health: 150
  Speed: Fast [flying]
 Damage: Self-Destruct: 30 [melee, explosive]

  Drops: N/A

     Sentry Drones, also known as jerks, are fast-moving bombs.  When one spots
you, it will engage its thrusters -- which make a distinctive whirring sound --
and accelerate towards you at full speed, exploding on contact.  What makes the
Sentry Drone especially annoying is its ability to dodge projectile weapons,
such as the Coconut Launcher.  It can only dodge the initial shot, not the
actual explosion, so there's still some use to be had from it at choke points.

Both the Super Soak'em and Triple Poison Shooter are very effective against
them, providing you have the space to move backwards.  Of course, they seldom
ever appear in large, open spaces, and the best you can sometimes do is turn
and run to somewhere more suitable as soon as you hear their engine fire up.
Because Sentry Drones are mechanical, you'll find them immune to the Voodoo
Ring, should they ever stop avoiding it.  Which they probably won't, so yeah.


 === Shark ===

 Health: 35
  Speed: Slow [swimming]
 Damage: Bite: 9 [melee]

  Drops: N/A

     Once a Shark spots you, it'll very slowly make its way over, where upon
arriving, it'll bite you.  That's basically it, really.  Their threat level is
minimal and their health is pitifully low.  As a way to sort-of-but-not-really
overcome the shortcomings of being a bit rubbish, they often come in shivers.
Despite it making sense for Sharks to attack everything, they won't.


 === Mini Battlelord ===

 Health: 1000
  Speed: Slow [ground]
 Damage: Chaingun: 6.5 x 6 [hitscan]
         Mortar: 50 [projectile, explosive]

  Drops: N/A

     Mini Battlelords are both ugly and tough in equal measure.  And they also
happen to be armed with a chaingun cannon and a mortar launcher.  The chaingun
cannon is a terrifying contraption that will shred you very easily at short-to-
medium range with even a few seconds of sustained fire.  Anything outside of
that range, however, is going to take very little damage.  But that's what the
mortar launcher is for.

If a mortar doesn't score a direct hit, it'll just sit around until you walk
into it or set it off, either by shooting it or using an explosive of your own.
In all probability, it'll be chaingun fire or another mortar that does it.
Because it's a mortar, its speed and trajectory will vary depending on your
distance from the Mini Battlelord.  That little wild card doesn't matter all
that much, though, as the mortar can be seen coming from a mile away, and is
terribly easy to avoid.

There are only four Mini Battlelords found throughout this expansion, but they
come as a two-for-one deal.  On both of those occasions, the available cover is
actually rather good, so the only real chance you have of taking damage is when
you strafe out to throw a couple of shots their way.  Because they have such a
glaring weakness, intended or not, to the Voodoo Ring, you'd be a bit crazy not
to use it.  You've read it before, and I know I've said it before, but just to
reiterate – turn off aim-assist and shoot at their feet.  If you'd rather do it
properly, they take six shots from the Coconut Launcher.  Other than that, I
really wouldn't recommended anything other than the Conchanator.


 === Cycloid Emperor ===

 Health: 4500
  Speed: Slow/Fast [ground]
 Damage: Coconut: 140 [projectile, explosive]
         Psychic Blast: 38 [projectile]
         Stomp: 1000 [melee]

  Drops: N/A

     If combated from a distance, the Emperor will primarily stick with sending
volleys of coconuts, while at medium range, it'll rely on its psychic blasts.
Coconuts are fired randomly, so there's no particular method of dodging them
reliably - you just have to keep your eyes open and stay back.  You want a good
long distance between you, but you also don't want to be too close to the wall,
otherwise you're going to eat a lot of splash damage.  Its intention to fire
coconuts is foreshadowed by it extending its arm, while its intention to use
psychic blasts is foreshadowed by it lowering its head.

The psychic blasts are much harder to avoid, with them travelling much closer
together, and only really spacing out towards the end of the room.  It's quite
possible to back-peddle and strafe as soon as an opening is available, but
usually, you'll just be minimising the number of blasts you get hit by.  If you
happen to be mental enough to get closer than that, you'll soon find that the
Emperor is capable of bursts of considerable speed.  If it should get close
enough to you, it'll stomp you flat.

Using anything lower than the Coconut Launcher is going to drag the fight out
forever, and you've no reason to conserve ammo at this point.  The Coconut
Launcher can score you victory in 30 hits, while the Conchanator will require 80
hits, but will obviously land them in far less time.  Being the Big Bad, the
Cycloid Emperor is immune to both the Voodoo Ring and the freezing effect of
the Ice Crusher.

 === Easter Eggs ===

 --- AKNOT? WOT? ---

  Where: Market Melee

     If you bypass the barrier that's blocking the alley near the start of the
level by using dnclip, you'll find this reference to The Fifth Element written
on the wall.


 --- BADABOOM ---

  Where: Market Melee

     In Secret Place 2, over by the boat, use dnclip to get through the boards
that block access to the ocean, then turn around to view this message magically
floating in the air.


 --- SO... COME HERE OFTEN? ---

  Where: The Wavemistress/Cruise Ship (multiplayer map)

     At the start of the level, behind the sun deck with the Inflatable Sea
Monsters is a white funnel with a couple of radio towers.  Use dnclip to reach
this area, then head around the back of the stack to view the message.


 --- CHEAT OFTEN? ---

  Where: The Wavemistress/Cruise Ship (multiplayer map)

     Exit the pool area by the stairs around to the right.  At the bottom, turn
left and look up - you should be able to see another white funnel.  Use dnclip
to reach that arena, then look around the back of the funnel for the message.


 --- STOP CHEATING ---

  Where: Lost Lagoon

     After exiting the cave at the start, use one of the item cheats to get a
Jet Pack, and fly up to the side of the river with the statue.  This message,
accompanied by a picture of Mr. Splashy, is written on the wall to the right.
As soon as you raise the archway that would allow you to cross normally, the
message will disappear.


 ==============================================================================
      Frequently Asked Questions                                     07.00
 ==============================================================================

 === General Questions ===

 Q: Why is my enemy kill count different from yours at the end of a level?

 A: There are a few possibilities, other than my general inability to count, I
    mean.  Assault Troopers that come back from the dead count when they're
    killed for a consecutive time, as do Protozoid Slimers that are hatched
    from frozen/shrunken Eggs.  And of course, playing on a lower difficulty
    setting will reduce the number of enemies, while playing on the highest
    will allow enemies to respawn if their bodies remain.


 Q: Did you know that you missed two hidden messages?

 A: They're not really hidden messages, though.  The first message, "DESTROY
    THE ONE THAT DOES NOT STAND THE SUN," is intended to be found (you're even
    given the means with which to see it in the dark), as it's a clue to help
    you progress (Lost Lagoon).  The second such message, "YOU PROBABLY CHEATED
    - BLISS," is just a cheeky message from one of the programmers, found in
    Secret Place 7 (Voodoo Caves), and can be reached during normal gameplay.


 === Questions About Weapons ===

 Q: Is the Microwave Expander available in Life's A Beach?

 A: It won't appear under normal gameplay, but if you enter an all-weapons
    cheat, you'll be able to add one to your inventory.  It's identical in
    appearance to the Voodoo Ring, but it won't actually deal any damage.
    It seems a bit odd to remove it, so I think it's safe to assume that its
    code was used for something else.


 === Questions About Levels ===

 --- Lost Lagoon ---

 Q: What's the deal with the teleporter in the crusher room?

 A: There doesn't seem to be any way to open them externally, and they don't
    have switches to open or close them from the inside like other teleporters,
    so I'm putting them down to being a removed feature or simply something to
    help out during testing.


 --- Voodoo Caves ---

 Q: How do you open the hidden door in the area with the pirate ship?

 A: I'm actually pretty sure you can't without cheating.  The door is clearly
    meant to allow you access to the rest of the level after you've dropped to
    the ship and trapped yourself, but I see no way to open it.  I assumed it
    would have something to do with the combination lock inside the ship, but
    my fiddling has proven fruitless.


 --- The Alien Remains ---

 Q: How do I open the hidden teleporter in the boss room?

 A: I know the answer to this one - you don't.  The teleporter leads from the
    start of the level straight to the boss, so it's obvious that it was never
    intended to be accessed via normal gameplay.  It's highly likely that it
    was used during play-testing to check the boss trigger event without having
    to go through the whole level or cheat.


 === Questions About This Guide ===

 Q: Can I use your guide on my site?

 A: As of this moment, no you cannot host my guide.  Why?  Because I believe
    that the number of sites that I'm allowing to host this guide is enough,
    enough to keep track of and enough to provide adequate distribution to you,
    the wonderful FAQ-reading public.


 Q: I have this guide, would it be okay if I used a part of yours?

 A: *Chokes* part of mine?  What would be the point of that?  You can use my
    guide as reference for all the things that I can't own (i.e. facts), but
    you can't go lifting entire paragraphs, even if you credit me for it.
    Just read the copyright notice at the top of this guide, and then think
    twice before 'borrowing' anything from me.


 Q: If I've found something that you were too stupid to include, or something
    that you've missed, what should I do?

 A: You could take it, turn it sideways and shove it... *ahem* just drop me
    a line and tell me in exact detail as to what it was that I screwed up on
    or missed out.  If you can help me to make this guide more accurate, youll
    win a cookie, a kudos cookie (great on calories, lousy on taste).

     It took me a little (read: far) longer than I expected to get this guide
finished, but yeah, I hope you liked it.  It's certainly the only guide I know
of for this rather obscure expansion pack, which I think deserves a high-five.
High-five!  Anyone?  No?  Well, it's that time again, friends, so if you're the
last one to leave, please make sure to turn off the lights.

     If for some strange reason, you would actually like to thank me, feel free
to pay me a visit and leave a comment [http://mikepenance.tumblr.com] and

"serving me for all eternity" bit (if you like).

No, Mr. President, they have no idea of my true identity.  Yes, Mr. President,
it all went according to plan.  Shall I continue with the second phase of the
operation?  Yes, sir, understood.
