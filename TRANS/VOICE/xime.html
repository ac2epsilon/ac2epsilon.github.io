    <h1>Xlock: new approach to think about time</h1>
    <h3>Terminology</h3>
    <p>We use X letter to denote everything related to heX (i.e. Hexadecimal)
      Clock. For example: <strong> xime</strong>(our time), <strong>xlock</strong>(our
      clock), <strong>xour</strong>(our hour), <strong>xinute</strong>(our
      minute). This approach let us not to juggle terms like <em>our hour</em>,
      <em>old hour</em>, <em>those minutes</em> etc. </p>
    <h3>Intention</h3>
    <p>Main intention of <strong>xlock</strong> is invent smart, reasonable,
      convenient and logical way shrink time-of-the-day into 1 byte (8 bits),
      without sacrificing practical usability for 95% of use cases. </p>
    <h3>Invariants </h3>
    <p>Invariant is something, which is not changing relating to given
      operation. For example, orthogonal vectors will be still orthogonal after
      rotation in space, while some other space deformation can change this
      relation between them. So <strong>xime</strong> invariants are:</p>
    <p>- Day and night are still day and night. I.e. whole day consists of two
      equal parts: night&amp;morning and day&amp;evening in such order (thank
      the Lord!).</p>
    <p>- Second remains same second in SI meaning, i.e. periods of radiation
      blah-blah-blah.This is not the part of minute or hour. </p>
    <p>- Also number of seconds in the day still remains, and equal to 60*60*24=
      86400 seconds in a whole day. </p>
    <p>- We discuss time-of-the-day only. All about years, months and weeks,
      including any corrections, additional seconds and leap years out of our
      scope and all of them stay unchanged. </p>
    <h3>What in xlock is changed?</h3>
    <p>- Second NOT a part of a minute any more, hour or whatever else. Actually
      <strong>xime</strong> have NO hours and minutes, but <strong>xours</strong>
      and <strong>xinutes</strong> instead (as mentioned above X stands for
      heX, which is 16). </p>
    <p>- Whole day consists of 16 <strong>xours</strong>, each xour consists of
      16 <strong>xinutes</strong>. </p>
    <p>- ATTENTION! One <strong>xinute</strong> consists of different number of
      seconds. There are short <strong>xinute</strong> = 225 seconds (3 min 45
      sec) and long <strong>xinute</strong> = 675 seconds (11 min 15 sec). As <strong>xour</strong>
      always equals 16 <strong>xinutes</strong>, there are short <strong>
        xours</strong> = 225*16=3600 seconds (which is one old plain hour) and
      long <strong>xour</strong> = 10800 seconds (3 former hours). </p>
    <p>- Long <strong>xours</strong> used to represent <strong>xime </strong>from
      0:00 to 6:00 and from 12:00 to 18:00. So in these "slow" zones <strong>xinute</strong>
      arm ticks one time in 11 min 45 sec. <br>
      Other time <strong>xinute</strong> arm ticks every 3 min 45 sec. As you
      can count night is TWO <strong>xours</strong> long (instead of six hours)
      and day is TWO <strong> xours</strong> long (instead of six hours). This
      just reflects the fact: morning and evening time is far most important in
      meaning of time resolution then night and afternoon! (We talk about usual
      people in usual situations. AND you always have seconds to be more
      specific) </p>
    <h3>Notation and implementation</h3>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h3>Little discussion</h3>
    <p>- <em>in these "slow" zones <strong>xinute</strong> arm ticks one time
        in 11 min 45 sec.</em> Yes. But really, who cares? Even taking your
      dinner was from 13:00 to 14:00, now it will be 8x5 (12:56:15) to 8xB
      (14:03:45). Your business is totally ill-screwed if such change can kill
      it. </p>
    <p>- <em>And what if I want more resolution? Give me seconds back! Ahhh! </em>Uhm..
      you have seconds all the time. For example 8xA:450 means 2PM o'clock. </p>
    <p>- <em>What the hell with those short xinutes. </em>Well, it's just very
      simple and convenient way to divide whole day into 16 peaces. If you just
      divide 86400 seconds by 256 you get 337.5, it's something 5 min 37.5
      seconds, which is not fun at all. And plus we feel it's too good
      resolution for the night and bad resolution for the morning. We also
      discussed approach with three <strong>xinute</strong> resolutions - 1 <strong>xour</strong>
      for the night, 3 for the day, and 6 for morning and evening, but we
      decided to make night and day symmetric. And 23+ min for the tick looks
      too poor resolution even for night time.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

    <h3>Why this is so important? </h3>
    <p>There are several reasons to snap for new <strong>xlock</strong>: </p>
    <p>- historical: for what on the Earth do we count to 60 minutes? Yes, I
      know the answer. Because in such "elegant" way you can divide one hour
      into three equal parts. And what? Do you say "one third past two"? Nope.
      We have the complication with no reason.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>- perceptual: do you really think in meaning of minutes? Especially in
      the night. Do you think "Sonny, you must be at home at 1:23:06". Ups. You
      rather say "Be at home not too late". And even 11 min resolution is great
      to explain what those <em>late</em> means. </p>
    - economical: how many petabytes of databases do filled with dates, times,
    data-and-times and things like this? And what bytes do it costs? For example
    your day-of-the-birth may be written as Oct/2/1994 12:06:40AM. 10 bytes for
    time with zero relevance. Who cares you may ask. Count on 7 billions persons
    and on some 100 database entries for every one. But not only this:
    transactions, inventory, logs (especially logs). And try imaginary replace
    every time stamp to 1 byte. You will get profit.
    <p>- practical: look, you see at clock and see something like 12:33:45AM.
      Good. And what? Compare to x000 00xx or even 8x3. I guarantee, for this
      simplicity you will <strong>xnow</strong> and <strong>xlove</strong> new
      <strong>xlock</strong> in one day! </p>
    <p>- informational: how do you think, how many bits refers to AM and PM?
      Yes, just one. Exactly what xlock offers. First bit says: 0 is AM, 1 is
      PM. One bit instead, well, two ASCII codes (16 bits if you lucky). Every <strong>xour</strong>
      after 8x means PM, okay? It was easy. And 1 byte completely used in every
      bit. Your CPU will thank you.&nbsp; <br>
