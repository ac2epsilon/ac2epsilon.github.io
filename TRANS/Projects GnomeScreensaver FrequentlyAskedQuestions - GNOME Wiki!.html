<span class="anchor" id="line-6"></span><p class="line874">gnome-screensaver is a new screensaver that can replace xscreensaver.  It is designed to integrate well with the desktop and provide a control interface that is desktop neutral.  It simplifies and streamlines the experience for the user and provides more capability for the system administrator and vendor. <span class="anchor" id="line-7"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span><p class="line874">It is designed to support: <span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span><ul><li>a desktop neutral control interface via DBus <span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span></li><li>a desktop neutral and standard way to install and manage screensaver themes <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span></li><li>switching users directly from the unlock dialog <span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span></li><li>allowing a system administrator to set a mandatory policy for any setting <span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span></li><li>a secure separation of user input processing and authentication from the screen locking window <span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span></li><li>a separation between the screensaver theme engine and the theme settings <span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span></li><li>integration with the desktop (themes, fonts, toolkit) <span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span></li><li>translation into many languages by the GNOME Translation Project <span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span></li><li>instantly applying settings changes <span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span></li></ul><p class="line867">

<span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span><p class="line874">Yes.  gnome-screensaver runs the screen lock password dialog in a separate process and embeds the interface using XEmbed.  It maintains a keyboard grab on the toplevel window at all times.  This way there is no transfer of grabs to cause a race condition.  The screensaver daemon is currently using the GTK+ implementation of the XEmbed protocol.  gnome-screensaver links to many more libraries than does xscreensaver.  These libraries are a result of using DBUS, GTK+, and GConf.  The actual code paths through these libraries are quite small and very well tested. <span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Can_I_use_xscreensaver_.22hacks.22_with_gnome-screensaver.3F">Can I use xscreensaver "hacks" with gnome-screensaver?</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span><p class="line874">Yes.  Any screensaver theme engines that support using the environment variable XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW should work without modification. <span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span><p class="line874">Actually, that seems to no longer be the case in GNOME3, after commit 76d2c9ff6acf4a98bfa1569a62fafe14e89f413e gnome-screensaver only seems to support blanking. <span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span><p class="line867">

<span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span><p class="line862">gnome-screensaver uses standard desktop entry (.desktop) files to define the screensaver themes.  Xscreensaver XML configuration files can be converted into .desktop files <span class="strike">using the migrate-xscreensaver-config.sh script in the <a class="http" href="http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/gnome-screensaver/trunk/data/">data directory of the gnome-screensaver sources</a></span> has since been removed, see <a class="http" href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-screensaver/log/data/migrate-xscreensaver-config.sh">http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-screensaver/log/data/migrate-xscreensaver-config.sh</a>. <span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Why_doesn.27t_the_screensaver_preferences_tool_allow_me_to_change_the_settings_for_the_theme.3F">Why doesn't the screensaver preferences tool allow me to change the settings for the theme?</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span><p class="line874">We are trying to take a different approach.  A gnome-screensaver theme is not directly equivalent to the xscreensaver concept of a "hack".  Each gnome-screensaver theme is a combination of a "hack" (or theme engine) and a set of options.  This is quite a different design.  So, perhaps, a better question is how does one create a new theme for a pre-existing theme engine?  For that please see the related section in this FAQ. <span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span><p class="line874">So, why use a design that separates the theme from the theme engine?  There are many reasons for this approach.  I'll try to explain some of them. <span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span><p class="line874">There are advantages for the user.  It demands that themes simply work and that the defaults make sense.  And in the case where no one set of defaults will work it is now possible to simply provide a related theme of a different name.  In many cases it makes sense to have multiple themes for the same theme engine.  Take for example the slideshow theme engine.  Rather than have one slideshow theme which you can configure to look in certain places for images it is now possible to have many slideshow themes - each with a different focus.  Or even install new ones! <span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span><p class="line874">This may even create a market for new or enhanced themes.  I can imagine that such demand will quickly be satisfied by the many third party theme sites such as art.gnome.org. <span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span><p class="line874">There are also many advantages for the parent, system administrator, or system distributor. <span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span><p class="line874">Under the xscreensaver model the only form of control a parent, system administrator, or vendor had was to remove "hacks" from the system.  There was no way to exercise control over any options or groups of options.  If they didn't want their child to see pornography the only recourse was to remove web reading "hacks" from the system.  If they didn't want someone to put "The CEO is a bastard" in rotating, 3D text on a publicly available computer the only option was to remove it form the system.  You get the idea. <span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span><p class="line874">So, now it is possible to allow the theme engines but to add restrictions based on sets of parameters. <span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-45"></span><p class="line874">One of the side effects is that initially, by default, there are fewer options.  That is until you go to a website and download and install the "Flickr Fireworks Tag Slideshow" theme. <span class="anchor" id="line-46"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-47"></span><p class="line874">There are also some technical reasons for the current behavior.  gnome-screensaver native themes do not require configuration.  So, the themes in question are actually xscreensaver "hacks".  For these, gnome-screensaver provides compatibility.  There are essentially two different types of xscreensaver "hacks": those that operate on data sources, those that do not operate on data sources.  Examples of "hacks" that operate on data sources are: GLSlideshow, GLText, Zoom.  Examples of "hacks" that do not operate on data sources are: Flurry, Fuzzy Flakes, Stoner View.  It is my contention that xscreensaver "hacks" that operate on data sources have no sensible default configuration because they are really theme engines and not themes.  These "hacks" may not be very compatible with gnome-screensaver at the moment. <span class="anchor" id="line-48"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-49"></span><p class="line874">When you talk about configuring xscreensaver "hacks" that operate on data sources you aren't really configuring the "hack" itself - you actually configure xscreensaver to provide data to these "hacks" via command line programs (xscreensaver-getimage-desktop, xscreensaver-getimage-file, xscreensaver-getimage-video, xscreensaver-text).  This configuration is shared by all xscreensaver "hacks".  One of the consequences of this is that you cannot use different data sources for different "hacks".  Also, there is no way to specify that some data sources may be trusted and used and others may not.  These are not behaviors that we want gnome-screensaver to copy. <span class="anchor" id="line-50"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-51"></span><p class="line874">All xscreensaver "hacks" store their configuration in the .xscreensaver file in the Home directory.  While it is possible to provide default settings via app-defaults there is no way to specify mandatory settings.  This way of doing things isn't ideal.  One option might be to convert all "hacks" to use GConf.  However, that is both impractical and problematic for establishing a freedesktop standard for screensaver themes. <span class="anchor" id="line-52"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-53"></span><p class="line874">xscreensaver "hacks" provide an XML file that is used by the screensaver framework to autogenerate a user interface.  It appears that xscreensaver does not support including translations in these XML files.  It does seem to attempt to translate the contents of these files on the fly but this only works with files that are included within xscreensaver because the translations have already been provided.  There doesn't seem to be a way to support translation of third-party screensaver themes.  It is not clear that is approach should be supported by gnome-screensaver or that would be appropriate for use in a freedesktop standard for screensaver themes. <span class="anchor" id="line-54"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-55"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="What_about_settings_for_themes_that_are_hardware_dependent.3F__They_are_really_slow_on_old_machines_and_really_fast_on_fast_machines.">What about settings for themes that are hardware dependent?  They are really slow on old machines and really fast on fast machines.</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-56"></span><p class="line874">I've been keeping an open mind about it.  I just haven't heard a compelling reason for them yet. <span class="anchor" id="line-57"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-58"></span><p class="line874">I totally agree that these are real problems.  These are actually very good examples of what we would like to fix. <span class="anchor" id="line-59"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-60"></span><p class="line874">There are a few reasons why fixing this by adding settings is not right.  Settings should be machine and architecture independent.  It is really bad if the user has to change a setting before they lock the screen on a machine with a different CPU. Not to mention that the average user will have no idea what speed the CPU and/or graphics card is.  Nor will they have any idea what value to use for the screensaver speed even if they did know the CPU speed.  The screensaver theme engine (aka "hack") is in the best position to determine what speed it should run at.  If it does not do this correctly then it is a bug that we should fix. <span class="anchor" id="line-61"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-62"></span><p class="line867">

<span class="anchor" id="line-109"></span><p class="line874">Yes.  gnome-screensaver has a simple to use DBus API for this.  The way it works is that your application will request that the screensaver activation on idle be "inhibited" until your application says that activation can be "allowed" or your application exits. <span class="anchor" id="line-110"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-111"></span><p class="line862">Please be warned that the gnome-screensaver DBus API is currently unstable and may change in the future.
