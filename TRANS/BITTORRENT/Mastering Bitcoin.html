    <h1>Опановуючи Bitcoin</h1>
    <h4>Програмування відкритого блокчейну</h4>
    <p>Долучіться до технологічної революції що захоплює фінансовий світ як
      шторм. Опановуючі Bitcoin є вашим провідником по, здавалось би, складному
      світові біткоіну, провадячи потрібні вам знання щоб приймати участь в
      інтернеті грошей. Чи ви будуєте наступне вбивче застосування, інвестуєте в
      стартап, або просто цікавитесь цією технологією, це перероблене та
      розширене друге видання провадить основні деталі, з яких ви маєте
      починати.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Швидкий глосарій</h3>
    <p> <strong>адреса</strong> біткоін виглядає як <strong>1DSrfJdB2AnWaFNgSbv3MZC2m74996JafV</strong>.
      Вона складається з рядка літер та чисел. Насправді це закодована версія <strong>base58check</strong>
      публічного ключа <strong>160-бітного хешу</strong>. Так само, як ви
      питаєте вислати поштову адресу на вашу адресу, ви можете запитати
      надіслати вам біткоіни на одну з ваших біткоін адрес.</p>
    <p> <strong>bip</strong>, Bitcoin Improvement Proposals. Набір пропозицій
      від членів спільноти, надісланих для покращення біткоіна. наприклад,
      BIP-21 є пропозиція покращити схему біткоінівськіх ідентифікаторів
      ресурсів (URI).<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>біткоін</strong> є назвою грошових одиниць (монет), так само як
      мережі та програмного забезпечення.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>блок</strong> - група транзакій, що помічені часовою відміткою,
      та відтиск від попереднього блоку. Заголовок блоку захешовано для
      отримання підтвердження виконаної роботи, що підтверджує транзакції.
      Валідні блоки додаються до блокчейну через мережевий консенсус.</p>
    <p><strong> блокчейн</strong> є списком валідних блоків, кожний пов'язаний
      зі своїм попередником, і далі так само, до первинного блоку. </p>
    <p> <strong>проблема візантійськіх генералів</strong>. Надійна комп'ютерна
      система має бути в змозі мати справу з одним або більше відмовами однієї
      або більше своїх компонент. Збійний компонент може виказувати тип
      поведінки, на яку зазвичай не звертають уваги — а саме, надсилати
      конфліктуючу інформацію до різних частей системи. Проблема при спілкуванні
      з такими збоями абстрактно виражена через проблему візантійськіх
      генералів..<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>коінбейс</strong> - спеціальне поле, що використовується як єдине
      джерело для транзакцій коінбейс. Коінбейс дозволяє підтвердити отримання
      нагороди за підпис блоку, та провадить 100 байтів довільних даних. На слід
      плутати з коінбейс транзакціями. </p>
    <p> <strong>коінбейс транзакція</strong> - перша транзакція в блоку. Завджи
      створюється майнером, та включає єдиний коінбейс. Не плутати з самим
      коінбейс. <br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>хололдне сховище</strong> посилається на зберігання біткоінів
      оффлайн. Холодне сховище утворюється через створення та зберігання
      приватних ключів Bitcoin в безпечному оточенні офлайн. Холодне сховище
      важливе для будь-кого, що має накопичення біткоінів. Комп'ютери онлайн є
      вразливі для хакерів, та не мають використовуватись для зберігання
      важливої кількості біткоінів. <br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>кольорові монети</strong>. Відкритий код протоколу <strong>Bitcoin
        2.0</strong> дозволяє розробникам створювати цифрові активи зверху
      блокчейну, використовуючи його функціональність за межами грошового обігу.
      <br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>підтвердження</strong>. Коли транзакція включається в блок, вона
      має одне підтвердження. Коли майнається інший блок в тому ж блокчейні,
      транзакція матиме два підтвердження, і так далі. <strong>Шість</strong>
      підтверджень вважаються достатнім підтвердженням, що транзакція не може
      бути відмінена. </p>
    <p> <strong>консенсус</strong> - коли декілька вузлів, звичайно, більшість
      вузлів в мережі, всі мають ті самі блоки в своїх найкращих валідованих
      ланцюжках блокчейну. Не плутати з правилами консенсусу.</p>
    <p> <strong>правила консенсусу</strong> - правила перевірки блоків, якім
      слідують повні вузли, щоб залишатись в стані консенсусу з іншими іузлами.
      Не плутати з консенсусом. </p>
    <p><strong>складність</strong> - налаштування рівня мережі, що контролює,
      скільки обчислень потрібно для продукування підтвердження виконанної
      роботи. <br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>переорієнтування складності</strong> - переобчислення для всієї
      мережі складності, що трапляється кожні <strong> 2,016</strong> блоків,
      та приймає до уваги потужність хешування попередніх 2,016 блоків.</p>
    <p><strong>цільова складність</strong> - складність, з якою всі обчислення в
      мережі будуть знаходити блоки з апроксімацією кожні <strong>10 хвилин</strong>.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>подвійне витрачання</strong> є результатом успішного використання
      деяких грошей більше ніж один раз. Bitcoin захищений від подвійного
      витрачання через верифікацію транзакцій, доданих до блокчейну, щоб
      переконатись, що всі входи для транзакції наразі не були витрачені до
      цього. <br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>ECDSA</strong>, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm є
      криптографічним алгоритмом, що використовує Bitcoin, щоб переконатись, що
      фонди можуть бути витрачені своїми справжніми власниками. <br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>додатковий довісок</strong>. По мірі зростання складності майнери
      часто проходять всі <strong>4 мільярди</strong> значень довіска, не
      знайшовши блок. Оскільки скрипт коінбейс може зберігати від <strong>2 до
        100 байтів</strong> даних, майнери починають використовувати цей
      додатковий простір як додатковий довісок, що дозволяє їм досліджувати
      значно більший диапазон значень заголовка блока, та знайти значення
      блока.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>(комісійні) збори. Надсилач транзакції часто включає комісію для мережі
      за обробку запитаної транзакції. Більшість транзакцій потребують мінімальні
      комісійні в <strong>0.5 mBTC</strong>.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>відгалуження</strong>, також відоме як випадкове відгалуження,
      трапляється, коли два або більше блоків мають ту саму висоту блоку, даючи
      розгалуження блокчейну. типово трапляється, коли два або більше майнери
      знаходять блоки в той самий час. Також може трапитись як частина атаки. <br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>первинний блок</strong> - перший блок в блокчейні,
      використовується для ініціалізації крипто валюти.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>жорстке розгалуження</strong>, також відоме як зміна жорсткого
      розгалуження, є постійне розділення блокчейну, загалом трапляється, коли
      неоновлені вузли не можуть перевірити блоки, створені оновленими вузлами,
      що слідують новим правилам валідації. Не плутати з розгалуженням, м'яким
      розгалуженням, програмним розгалуженням та розгалуженням Git.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>апаратний гаманець</strong> є спеціальним типом гаманця біткоін,
      що зберігає приватні ключі користувача на безпечному апаратному пристрої.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>хеш</strong> - цифровий відтиск деякого бінарного значення.</p>
    <p><strong>хеш блокування</strong> є типом перешкод, що обмежує витрату
      входу, докі деяка вказана частина даних не буде публічно розкрита. Хеш
      блокування має корисну властивість, що коли одне з блокувань стає
      розкритим публічно, любі інші хеш блокування, захищені тим самим ключем,
      також можуть бути відкриті. Це робить можливим створити декілька виходів,
      що зачинені тим самим хеш блокуванням, та які всі стає можливо витрачати
      одночасно.</p>
    <p><strong>протокол HD</strong>, Hierarchical Deterministic (HD), протокол
      для створення та передачі ключів (<strong>BIP32</strong>), що дозволяє
      створення&nbsp; дочірніх ключів від батьківськів в ієрархії.</p>
    <p><strong>гаманець HD</strong> використовує Hierarchical Deterministic
      (протокол HD) для створення ключів (BIP32).</p>
    <p> <strong>зерно HD гаманця</strong>, або кореневе зерно є потенційно
      short value used as a seed to generate<br>
      the master private key and master chain code for an HD wallet.<br>
    </p>
    <p>HTLC<br>
      A Hashed TimeLock Contract or HTLC is a class of payments that use
      hashlocks<br>
      and timelocks to require that the receiver of a payment either acknowledge<br>
      receiving the payment prior to a deadline by generating cryptographic
      proof of<br>
      payment or forfeit the ability to claim the payment, returning it to the
      payer.<br>
    </p>
    <p>KYC<br>
      Know your customer (KYC) is the process of a business, identifying and
      verify‐<br>
      ing the identity of its clients. The term is also used to refer to the
      bank regulation<br>
      which governs these activities.<br>
    </p>
    <p>LevelDB<br>
      LevelDB is an open source on-disk key-value store. LevelDB is a
      light-weight,<br>
      single-purpose library for persistence with bindings to many platforms.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Lightning Networks<br>
      Lightning Network is a proposed implementation of Hashed Timelock
      Contracts<br>
      (HTLCs) with bi-directional payment channels which allows payments to be<br>
      securely routed across multiple peer-to-peer payment channels. This allows
      the<br>
      formation of a network where any peer on the network can pay any other
      peer<br>
      even if they don’t directly have a channel open between each other.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Locktime<br>
      Locktime, or more technically nLockTime, is the part of a transaction
      which<br>
      indicates the earliest time or earliest block when that transaction may be
      added to<br>
      the block chain.<br>
    </p>
    <p>mempool<br>
      The bitcoin Mempool (memory pool) is a collection of all transaction data
      in a<br>
      block that have been verified by bitcoin nodes, but are not yet confirmed.<br>
    </p>
    <p>merkle root<br>
      The root node of a merkle tree, a descendant of all the hashed pairs in
      the tree.<br>
      Block headers must include a valid merkle root descended from all
      transactions<br>
      in that block.<br>
    </p>
    <p>merkle tree<br>
      A tree constructed by hashing paired data (the leaves), then pairing and
      hashing<br>
      the results until a single hash remains, the merkle root. In Bitcoin, the
      leaves are<br>
      almost always transactions from a single block.<br>
    </p>
    <p>miner<br>
      A network node that finds valid proof of work for new blocks, by repeated
      hash‐<br>
      ing.<br>
    </p>
    <p>multisignature<br>
      Multisignature (multisig) refers to requiring more than one key to
      authorize a<br>
      bitcoin transaction.<br>
    </p>
    <p>network<br>
      A peer-to-peer network that propagates transactions and blocks to every
      bitcoin<br>
      node on the network.<br>
    </p>
    <p>nonce<br>
      The “nonce” in a bitcoin block is a 32-bit (4-byte) field whose value is
      set so that<br>
      the hash of the block will contain a run of leading zeros. The rest of the
      fields<br>
      may not be changed, as they have a defined meaning.<br>
    </p>
    <p>off-chain transactions<br>
      An off-chain transaction is the movement of value outside of the block
      chain.<br>
      While an on-chain transaction—usually referred to as simply a transaction—<br>
      modifies the blockchain and depends on the blockchain to determine its
      validity<br>
      an off-chain transaction relies on other methods to record and validate
      the trans‐<br>
      action.<br>
    </p>
    <p>opcode<br>
      Operation codes from the Bitcoin Script language which push data or
      perform<br>
      functions within a pubkey script or signature script.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Open Assets protocol<br>
      The Open Assets Protocol is a simple and powerful protocol built on top of
      the<br>
      bitcoin blockchain. It allows issuance and transfer of user-created
      assets. The<br>
      Open Assets protocol is an evolution of the concept of colored coins.<br>
    </p>
    <p>OP_RETURN<br>
      An opcode used in one of the outputs in an OP_RETURN transaction. Not to
      be<br>
      confused with OP_RETURN transaction.<br>
    </p>
    <p>OP_RETURN transaction<br>
      A transaction type relayed and mined by default in Bitcoin Core 0.9.0 and
      later<br>
      that adds arbitrary data to a provably unspendable pubkey script that full
      nodes<br>
      don’t have to store in their UTXO database. Not to be confused with<br>
      OP_RETURN opcode.<br>
    </p>
    <p>orphan block<br>
      Blocks whose parent block has not been processed by the local node, so
      they can’t<br>
      be fully validated yet.<br>
    </p>
    <p>orphan transactions<br>
      Transactions that can’t go into the pool due to one or more missing input
      trans‐<br>
      actions.<br>
    </p>
    <p>output<br>
      Output, transaction output, or TxOut is an output in a transaction which
      con‐<br>
      tains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more satoshis and
      a pubkey<br>
      script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those satoshis
      to be fur‐<br>
      ther spent.<br>
    </p>
    <p>P2PKH<br>
      Transactions that pay a bitcoin address contain P2PKH or Pay To PubKey
      Hash<br>
      scripts. An output locked by a P2PKH script can be unlocked (spent) by
      present‐<br>
      ing a public key and a digital signature created by the corresponding
      private key.<br>
    </p>
    <p>P2SH<br>
      P2SH or Pay-to-Script-Hash is a powerful new type of transaction that
      greatly<br>
      simplifies the use of complex transaction scripts. With P2SH the complex
      script<br>
      that details the conditions for spending the output (redeem script) is not
      presen‐<br>
      ted in the locking script. Instead, only a hash of it is in the locking
      script.<br>
    </p>
    <p>P2SH address<br>
      P2SH addresses are Base58Check encodings of the 20-byte hash of a script,
      P2SH<br>
      addresses use the version prefix “5”, which results in Base58Check-encoded<br>
      addresses that start with a “3”. P2SH addresses hide all of the
      complexity, so that<br>
      the person making a payment does not see the script.<br>
    </p>
    <p>P2WPKH<br>
      The signature of a P2WPKH (Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash) contains the<br>
      same information as a P2PKH spending, but is located in the witness field<br>
      instead of the scriptSig field. The scriptPubKey is also modified.<br>
    </p>
    <p>P2WSH<br>
      The difference between P2SH and P2WSH (Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash) is<br>
      about the cryptographic proof location change from the scriptSig field to
      the wit‐<br>
      ness field and the scriptPubKey that is also modified.<br>
    </p>
    <p>paper wallet<br>
      In the most specific sense, a paper wallet is a document containing all of
      the data<br>
      necessary to generate any number of Bitcoin private keys, forming a wallet
      of<br>
      keys. However, people often use the term to mean any way of storing
      bitcoin off‐<br>
      line as a physical document. This second definition also includes paper
      keys and<br>
      redeemable codes.<br>
    </p>
    <p>payment channels<br>
      A micropayment channel or payment channel is class of techniques designed
      to<br>
      allow users to make multiple bitcoin transactions without committing all
      of the<br>
      transactions to the bitcoin blockchain. In a typical payment channel, only
      two<br>
      transactions are added to the block chain but an unlimited or nearly
      unlimited<br>
      number of payments can be made between the participants.<br>
    </p>
    <p>pooled mining<br>
      Pooled mining is a mining approach where multiple generating clients
      contribute<br>
      to the generation of a block, and then split the block reward according
      the con‐<br>
      tributed processing power.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Proof-of-Stake<br>
      Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a method by which a cryptocurrency blockchain
      network<br>
      aims to achieve distributed consensus. Proof-of-Stake asks users to prove
      owner‐<br>
      ship of a certain amount of currency (their “stake” in the currency).<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>підтвердження виконанної роботи</strong>, Proof-of-Work - частина
      даних, що потребує виконання значних обчислень, щоб бути знайденою. В
      біткоіні, майнери мають знайти числове рішення алгоритма <strong>SHA256</strong>,
      що задовільняє мережевій цільовій складності.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>винагорода</strong> - сума, що вкладається в кожний новий блок,
      як винагорода від мережі майнеру, хто знайшов рішення підтвердження
      виконанної роботи. На сьогодні це<strong> 12.5 BTC</strong> за блок.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>RIPEMD-160</strong> є 160-бітною криптографічною хеш функцією.
      RIPEMD-160 є посиленою версією RIPEMD з 160-бітовим результатом хеша, та
      очікується, що буде безпечною протягом найближчих десяти років, або
      більше. <br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>сатоші</strong> є найменьшою одиницею обміну біткоінами, що може
      бути записана в блокчейні. Вона еквівалентна <strong>0.00000001</strong>
      біткоінам та названа на честь створювача Bitcoinа, Satoshi Nakamoto.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong> - ім'я, використане персоною або
      людьми, хто розробив Bitcoin та створив оригінальну референсну реалізацію,
      Bitcoin Core. Як частина реалізації, вони також розробили першу базу даних
      блокчейна. В процесі вони першими вирішили проблему подвійної витрати для
      цифрових грошей. Їх дійсні імена залишаються невідомими. <br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>скрипт</strong>. Bitcoin використовує скриптову систему для
      транзакцій. Система скриптів проста та скидаєтсья на Forth, базується на
      стеку, та обробляється зліва направо. Вона навмисно не Т'юрінг-повна, бо
      не має циклів. <br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>скрипт ScriptPubKey</strong> (також скрипт pubkey) - скрипт,
      включений в вихід, що встановлює умови, яким треба задовільняти, щоб
      витратити ці сатоші. Дані, потрібні щоб задовільнити умовам, мають бути
      запроваджені в скрипті. <br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>підпис ScriptSig</strong> (також скрипт сигнатури) - дані,
      згенеровані тим, хто витрачає, що майже завжди використовуються як змінні,
      щоб задовільнити скрипт <strong>pubkey</strong>.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>секретний ключ</strong> (він же приватний ключ) - секретне число,
      що відкриває біткоіни, надіслані на відповідну адресу. Секретний ключ
      виглядає таким чином: 5J76sF8L5jTtzE96r66Sf8cka9y44wdpJjMwCxR3tzLh3ibVPxh<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>відокремлене свідоцтво</strong> є запропоноване оновлення до
      протоколу Bitcoin, що є технологічною іновацією, яка відокремлює дані
      підпису від транзакцій біткоін. Відокремлене свідоцтво є запропонованих
      м'яким відгалуженням; ця зміна технічно робить протокол Bitcoin більш обмежуючим.
      <br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>SHA</strong>, Secure Hash Algorithm, або безпечний хеш-алгоритм,
      є сімейство кріптографічних хеш функцій, опублікованих Національним
      інститутом стандартів та технології&nbsp; (NIST).<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>SPV</strong>, simplified payment verification, або спрощена
      верифікація є метод для верифікації часткових транзакцій, що включені в
      блок, без завантаження самого блоку. Метод використовується в деяких
      легковажних клієнтах Bitcoin.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>м'яке розгалуження</strong>, або зміна м'якого розгалуження є
      тимчасовим розгалуженням в блокчейні, що загалом трапляється, коли майнери
      використовують неоновлені вузли, що не слідують новим правилам консенсусу,
      про який вони не знають. Не плутати з розгалуженням, жорстким
      розгалуженням, програмних розгалуженням та розгалуженням Git.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>стабільний блок</strong> - такий, що успішно змайнений, але не
      включений в поточний кращий ланцюжок блокчейн, вірогідно тому, що деякий
      інший блок з такою самою висотою розширив блок раніше. <br>

      Introduction<br>
      What Is Bitcoin?<br>
      Bitcoin is a collection of concepts and technologies that form the basis
      of a digital<br>
      money ecosystem. Units of currency called bitcoin are used to store and
      transmit<br>
      value among participants in the bitcoin network. Bitcoin users communicate
      with<br>
      each other using the bitcoin protocol primarily via the internet, although
      other trans‐<br>
      port networks can also be used. The bitcoin protocol stack, available as
      open source<br>
      software, can be run on a wide range of computing devices, including
      laptops and<br>
      smartphones, making the technology easily accessible.<br>
      Users can transfer bitcoin over the network to do just about anything that
      can be<br>
      done with conventional currencies, including buy and sell goods, send
      money to peo‐<br>
      ple or organizations, or extend credit. Bitcoin can be purchased, sold,
      and exchanged<br>
      for other currencies at specialized currency exchanges. Bitcoin in a sense
      is the per‐<br>
      fect form of money for the internet because it is fast, secure, and
      borderless.<br>
      Unlike traditional currencies, bitcoin are entirely virtual. There are no
      physical coins<br>
      or even digital coins per se. The coins are implied in transactions that
      transfer value<br>
      from sender to recipient. Users of bitcoin own keys that allow them to
      prove owner‐<br>
      ship of bitcoin in the bitcoin network. With these keys they can sign
      transactions to<br>
      unlock the value and spend it by transferring it to a new owner. Keys are
      often stored<br>
      in a digital wallet on each user’s computer or smartphone. Possession of
      the key that<br>
      can sign a transaction is the only prerequisite to spending bitcoin,
      putting the control<br>
      entirely in the hands of each user.<br>
      Bitcoin is a distributed, peer-to-peer system. As such there is no
      “central” server or<br>
      point of control. Bitcoin are created through a process called “mining,”
      which<br>
      involves competing to find solutions to a mathematical problem while
      processing bit‐<br>
      coin transactions. Any participant in the bitcoin network (i.e., anyone
      using a device<br>
      1<br>
      running the full bitcoin protocol stack) may operate as a miner, using
      their comput‐<br>
      er’s processing power to verify and record transactions. Every 10 minutes,
      on average,<br>
      a bitcoin miner is able to validate the transactions of the past 10
      minutes and is<br>
      rewarded with brand new bitcoin. Essentially, bitcoin mining decentralizes
      the<br>
      currency-issuance and clearing functions of a central bank and replaces
      the need for<br>
      any central bank.<br>
      The bitcoin protocol includes built-in algorithms that regulate the mining
      function<br>
      across the network. The difficulty of the processing task that miners must
      perform is<br>
      adjusted dynamically so that, on average, someone succeeds every 10
      minutes regard‐<br>
      less of how many miners (and how much processing) are competing at any
      moment.<br>
      The protocol also halves the rate at which new bitcoin are created every 4
      years, and<br>
      limits the total number of bitcoin that will be created to a fixed total
      just below 21<br>
      million coins. The result is that the number of bitcoin in circulation
      closely follows an<br>
      easily predictable curve that approaches 21 million by the year 2140. Due
      to bitcoin’s<br>
      diminishing rate of issuance, over the long term, the bitcoin currency is
      deflationary.<br>
      Furthermore, bitcoin cannot be inflated by “printing” new money above and
      beyond<br>
      the expected issuance rate.<br>
      Behind the scenes, bitcoin is also the name of the protocol, a
      peer-to-peer network,<br>
      and a distributed computing innovation. The bitcoin currency is really
      only the first<br>
      application of this invention. Bitcoin represents the culmination of
      decades of<br>
      research in cryptography and distributed systems and includes four key
      innovations<br>
      brought together in a unique and powerful combination. Bitcoin consists
      of:<br>
      • A decentralized peer-to-peer network (the bitcoin protocol)<br>
      • A public transaction ledger (the blockchain)<br>
      • A set of rules for independent transaction validation and currency
      issuance (con‐<br>
      sensus rules)<br>
      • A mechanism for reaching global decentralized consensus on the valid
      block‐<br>
      chain (Proof-of-Work algorithm)<br>
      As a developer, I see bitcoin as akin to the internet of money, a network
      for propagat‐<br>
      ing value and securing the ownership of digital assets via distributed
      computation.<br>
      There’s a lot more to bitcoin than first meets the eye.<br>
      In this chapter we’ll get started by explaining some of the main concepts
      and terms,<br>
      getting the necessary software, and using bitcoin for simple transactions.
      In following<br>
      chapters we’ll start unwrapping the layers of technology that make bitcoin
      possible<br>
      and examine the inner workings of the bitcoin network and protocol.<br>
      2<br>
      &nbsp;| Chapter 1: Introduction<br>
      Digital Currencies Before Bitcoin<br>
      The emergence of viable digital money is closely linked to developments in
      cryptog‐<br>
      raphy. This is not surprising when one considers the fundamental
      challenges involved<br>
      with using bits to represent value that can be exchanged for goods and
      services. Three<br>
      basic questions for anyone accepting digital money are:<br>
      1. Can I trust that the money is authentic and not counterfeit?<br>
      2. Can I trust that the digital money can only be spent once (known as the
      “double-<br>
      spend” problem)?<br>
      3. Can I be sure that no one else can claim this money belongs to them and
      not me?<br>
      Issuers of paper money are constantly battling the counterfeiting problem
      by using<br>
      increasingly sophisticated papers and printing technology. Physical money
      addresses<br>
      the double-spend issue easily because the same paper note cannot be in two
      places at<br>
      once. Of course, conventional money is also often stored and transmitted
      digitally. In<br>
      these cases, the counterfeiting and double-spend issues are handled by
      clearing all<br>
      electronic transactions through central authorities that have a global
      view of the cur‐<br>
      rency in circulation. For digital money, which cannot take advantage of
      esoteric inks<br>
      or holographic strips, cryptography provides the basis for trusting the
      legitimacy of a<br>
      user’s claim to value. Specifically, cryptographic digital signatures
      enable a user to<br>
      sign a digital asset or transaction proving the ownership of that asset.
      With the appro‐<br>
      priate architecture, digital signatures also can be used to address the
      double-spend<br>
      issue.<br>
      When cryptography started becoming more broadly available and understood
      in the<br>
      late 1980s, many researchers began trying to use cryptography to build
      digital curren‐<br>
      cies. These early digital currency projects issued digital money, usually
      backed by a<br>
      national currency or precious metal such as gold.<br>
      Although these earlier digital currencies worked, they were centralized
      and, as a<br>
      result, were easy to attack by governments and hackers. Early digital
      currencies used a<br>
      central clearinghouse to settle all transactions at regular intervals,
      just like a tradi‐<br>
      tional banking system. Unfortunately, in most cases these nascent digital
      currencies<br>
      were targeted by worried governments and eventually litigated out of
      existence. Some<br>
      failed in spectacular crashes when the parent company liquidated abruptly.
      To be<br>
      robust against intervention by antagonists, whether legitimate governments
      or crimi‐<br>
      nal elements, a decentralized digital currency was needed to avoid a
      single point of<br>
      attack. Bitcoin is such a system, decentralized by design, and free of any
      central<br>
      authority or point of control that can be attacked or corrupted.<br>
      What Is Bitcoin?<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;3<br>
      History of Bitcoin<br>
      Bitcoin was invented in 2008 with the publication of a paper titled
      “Bitcoin: A Peer-<br>
      to-Peer Electronic Cash System,”1 written under the alias of Satoshi
      Nakamoto (see<br>
      Appendix A). Nakamoto combined several prior inventions such as b-money
      and<br>
      HashCash to create a completely decentralized electronic cash system that
      does not<br>
      rely on a central authority for currency issuance or settlement and
      validation of trans‐<br>
      actions. The key innovation was to use a distributed computation system
      (called a<br>
      “Proof-of-Work” algorithm) to conduct a global “election” every 10
      minutes, allowing<br>
      the decentralized network to arrive at consensus about the state of
      transactions. This<br>
      elegantly solves the issue of double-spend where a single currency unit
      can be spent<br>
      twice. Previously, the double-spend problem was a weakness of digital
      currency and<br>
      was addressed by clearing all transactions through a central
      clearinghouse.<br>
      The bitcoin network started in 2009, based on a reference implementation
      published<br>
      by Nakamoto and since revised by many other programmers. The
      implementation of<br>
      the Proof-of-Work algorithm (mining) that provides security and resilience
      for bit‐<br>
      coin has increased in power exponentially, and now exceeds the combined
      processing<br>
      power of the world’s top supercomputers. Bitcoin’s total market value has
      at times<br>
      exceeded $35 billion US dollars, depending on the bitcoin-to-dollar
      exchange rate.<br>
      The largest transaction processed so far by the network was $150 million
      US dollars,<br>
      transmitted instantly and processed without any fees.<br>
      Satoshi Nakamoto withdrew from the public in April 2011, leaving the
      responsibility<br>
      of developing the code and network to a thriving group of volunteers. The
      identity of<br>
      the person or people behind bitcoin is still unknown. However, neither
      Satoshi Naka‐<br>
      moto nor anyone else exerts individual control over the bitcoin system,
      which oper‐<br>
      ates based on fully transparent mathematical principles, open source code,
      and<br>
      consensus among participants. The invention itself is groundbreaking and
      has<br>
      already spawned new science in the fields of distributed computing,
      economics, and<br>
      econometrics.<br>
      A Solution to a Distributed Computing Problem<br>
      Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention is also a practical and novel solution to a
      problem in<br>
      distributed computing, known as the “Byzantine Generals’ Problem.”
      Briefly, the<br>
      problem consists of trying to agree on a course of action or the state of
      a system by<br>
      exchanging information over an unreliable and potentially compromised
      network.<br>
      Satoshi Nakamoto’s solution, which uses the concept of Proof-of-Work to
      achieve<br>
      consensus without a central trusted authority, represents a breakthrough
      in dis‐<br>
      tributed computing and has wide applicability beyond currency. It can be
      used to ach‐<br>

      Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories<br>
      Bitcoin is an innovation in the ancient technology of money. At its core,
      money sim‐<br>
      ply facilitates the exchange of value between people. Therefore, in order
      to fully<br>
      understand bitcoin and its uses, we’ll examine it from the perspective of
      people using<br>
      it. Each of the people and their stories, as listed here, illustrates one
      or more specific<br>
      use cases. We’ll be seeing them throughout the book:<br>
      North American low-value retail<br>
      Alice lives in Northern California’s Bay Area. She has heard about bitcoin
      from<br>
      her techie friends and wants to start using it. We will follow her story
      as she<br>
      learns about bitcoin, acquires some, and then spends some of her bitcoin
      to buy a<br>
      cup of coffee at Bob’s Cafe in Palo Alto. This story will introduce us to
      the soft‐<br>
      ware, the exchanges, and basic transactions from the perspective of a
      retail con‐<br>
      sumer.<br>
      North American high-value retail<br>
      Carol is an art gallery owner in San Francisco. She sells expensive
      paintings for<br>
      bitcoin. This story will introduce the risks of a “51%” consensus attack
      for retail‐<br>
      ers of high-value items.<br>
      Offshore contract services<br>
      Bob, the cafe owner in Palo Alto, is building a new website. He has
      contracted<br>
      with an Indian web developer, Gopesh, who lives in Bangalore, India.
      Gopesh has<br>
      agreed to be paid in bitcoin. This story will examine the use of bitcoin
      for out‐<br>
      sourcing, contract services, and international wire transfers.<br>
      Web store<br>
      Gabriel is an enterprising young teenager in Rio de Janeiro, running a
      small web<br>
      store that sells bitcoin-branded t-shirts, coffee mugs, and stickers.
      Gabriel is too<br>
      young to have a bank account, but his parents are encouraging his
      entrepreneu‐<br>
      rial spirit.<br>
      Charitable donations<br>
      Eugenia is the director of a children’s charity in the Philippines.
      Recently she has<br>
      discovered bitcoin and wants to use it to reach a whole new group of
      foreign and<br>
      domestic donors to fundraise for her charity. She’s also investigating
      ways to use<br>
      bitcoin to distribute funds quickly to areas of need. This story will show
      the use<br>
      of bitcoin for global fundraising across currencies and borders and the
      use of an<br>
      open ledger for transparency in charitable organizations.<br>

      Import/export<br>
      Mohammed is an electronics importer in Dubai. He’s trying to use bitcoin
      to buy<br>
      electronics from the United States and China for import into the UAE to
      acceler‐<br>
      ate the process of payments for imports. This story will show how bitcoin
      can be<br>
      used for large business-to-business international payments tied to
      physical goods.<br>
      Mining for bitcoin<br>
      Jing is a computer engineering student in Shanghai. He has built a
      “mining” rig<br>
      to mine for bitcoin using his engineering skills to supplement his income.
      This<br>
      story will examine the “industrial” base of bitcoin: the specialized
      equipment<br>
      used to secure the bitcoin network and issue new currency.<br>
      Each of these stories is based on the real people and real industries
      currently using<br>
      bitcoin to create new markets, new industries, and innovative solutions to
      global eco‐<br>
      nomic issues.<br>
      Getting Started<br>
      Bitcoin is a protocol that can be accessed using a client application that
      speaks the<br>
      protocol. A “bitcoin wallet” is the most common user interface to the
      bitcoin system,<br>
      just like a web browser is the most common user interface for the HTTP
      protocol.<br>
      There are many implementations and brands of bitcoin wallets, just like
      there are<br>
      many brands of web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Internet
      Explorer).<br>
      And just like we all have our favorite browsers (Mozilla Firefox, Yay!)
      and our villains<br>
      (Internet Explorer, Yuck!), bitcoin wallets vary in quality, performance,
      security, pri‐<br>
      vacy, and reliability. There is also a reference implementation of the
      bitcoin protocol<br>
      that includes a wallet, known as the “Satoshi Client” or “Bitcoin Core,”
      which is<br>
      derived from the original implementation written by Satoshi Nakamoto.<br>
      Choosing a Bitcoin Wallet<br>
      Bitcoin wallets are one of the most actively developed applications in the
      bitcoin eco‐<br>
      system. There is intense competition, and while a new wallet is probably
      being devel‐<br>
      oped right now, several wallets from last year are no longer actively
      maintained. Many<br>
      wallets focus on specific platforms or specific uses and some are more
      suitable for<br>
      beginners while others are filled with features for advanced users.
      Choosing a wallet<br>
      is highly subjective and depends on the use and user expertise. It is
      therefore impossi‐<br>
      ble to recommend a specific brand or project of wallet. However, we can
      categorize<br>
      bitcoin wallets according to their platform and function and provide some
      clarity<br>
      about all the different types of wallets that exist. Better yet, moving
      money between<br>
      bitcoin wallets is easy, cheap, and fast, so it is worth trying out
      several different wal‐<br>
      lets until you find one that fits your needs.<br>
      6<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 1: Introduction<br>
      Bitcoin wallets can be categorized as follows, according to the platform:<br>
      Desktop wallet<br>
      A desktop wallet was the first type of bitcoin wallet created as a
      reference imple‐<br>
      mentation and many users run desktop wallets for the features, autonomy,
      and<br>
      control they offer. Running on general-use operating systems such as
      Windows<br>
      and Mac OS has certain security disadvantages however, as these platforms
      are<br>
      often insecure and poorly configured.<br>
      Mobile wallet<br>
      A mobile wallet is the most common type of bitcoin wallet. Running on
      smart-<br>
      phone operating systems such as Apple iOS and Android, these wallets are
      often<br>
      a great choice for new users. Many are designed for simplicity and
      ease-of-use,<br>
      but there are also fully featured mobile wallets for power users.<br>
      Web wallet<br>
      Web wallets are accessed through a web browser and store the user’s wallet
      on a<br>
      server owned by a third party. This is similar to webmail in that it
      relies entirely<br>
      on a third-party server. Some of these services operate using client-side
      code run‐<br>
      ning in the user’s browser, which keeps control of the bitcoin keys in the
      hands of<br>
      the user. Most, however, present a compromise by taking control of the
      bitcoin<br>
      keys from users in exchange for ease-of-use. It is inadvisable to store
      large<br>
      amounts of bitcoin on third-party systems.<br>
      Hardware wallet<br>
      Hardware wallets are devices that operate a secure self-contained bitcoin
      wallet<br>
      on special-purpose hardware. They are operated via USB with a desktop web<br>
      browser or via near-field-communication (NFC) on a mobile device. By
      handling<br>
      all bitcoin-related operations on the specialized hardware, these wallets
      are con‐<br>
      sidered very secure and suitable for storing large amounts of bitcoin.<br>
      Paper wallet<br>
      The keys controlling bitcoin can also be printed for long-term storage.
      These are<br>
      known as paper wallets even though other materials (wood, metal, etc.) can
      be<br>
      used. Paper wallets offer a low-tech but highly secure means of storing
      bitcoin<br>
      long term. Offline storage is also often referred to as cold storage.<br>
      Another way to categorize bitcoin wallets is by their degree of autonomy
      and how<br>
      they interact with the bitcoin network:<br>
      Full-node client<br>
      A full client, or “full node,” is a client that stores the entire history
      of bitcoin<br>
      transactions (every transaction by every user, ever), manages users’
      wallets, and<br>
      can initiate transactions directly on the bitcoin network. A full node
      handles all<br>
      aspects of the protocol and can independently validate the entire
      blockchain and<br>
      Getting Started<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;7<br>
      any transaction. A full-node client consumes substantial computer
      resources<br>
      (e.g., more than 125 GB of disk, 2 GB of RAM) but offers complete autonomy<br>
      and independent transaction verification.<br>
      Lightweight client<br>
      A lightweight client, also known as a simple-payment-verification (SPV)
      client,<br>
      connects to bitcoin full nodes (mentioned previously) for access to the
      bitcoin<br>
      transaction information, but stores the user wallet locally and
      independently cre‐<br>
      ates, validates, and transmits transactions. Lightweight clients interact
      directly<br>
      with the bitcoin network, without an intermediary.<br>
      Third-party API client<br>
      A third-party API client is one that interacts with bitcoin through a
      third-party<br>
      system of application programming interfaces (APIs), rather than by
      connecting<br>
      to the bitcoin network directly. The wallet may be stored by the user or
      by third-<br>
      party servers, but all transactions go through a third party.<br>
      Combining these categorizations, many bitcoin wallets fall into a few
      groups, with the<br>
      three most common being desktop full client, mobile lightweight wallet,
      and web<br>
      third-party wallet. The lines between different categories are often
      blurry, as many<br>
      wallets run on multiple platforms and can interact with the network in
      different ways.<br>
      For the purposes of this book, we will be demonstrating the use of a
      variety of down‐<br>
      loadable bitcoin clients, from the reference implementation (Bitcoin Core)
      to mobile<br>
      and web wallets. Some of the examples will require the use of Bitcoin
      Core, which, in<br>
      addition to being a full client, also exposes APIs to the wallet, network,
      and transac‐<br>
      tion services. If you are planning to explore the programmatic interfaces
      into the bit‐<br>
      coin system, you will need to run Bitcoin Core, or one of the alternative
      clients (see<br>
      “Alternative Clients, Libraries, and Toolkits” on page 51).<br>
      Quick Start<br>
      Alice, who we introduced in “Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories” on
      page 5, is not<br>
      a technical user and only recently heard about bitcoin from her friend
      Joe. While at a<br>
      party, Joe is once again enthusiastically explaining bitcoin to all around
      him and is<br>
      offering a demonstration. Intrigued, Alice asks how she can get started
      with bitcoin.<br>
      Joe says that a mobile wallet is best for new users and he recommends a
      few of his<br>
      favorite wallets. Alice downloads “Mycelium” for Android and installs it
      on her<br>
      phone.<br>
      When Alice runs Mycelium for the first time, as with many bitcoin wallets,
      the appli‐<br>
      cation automatically creates a new wallet for her. Alice sees the wallet
      on her screen,<br>
      as shown in Figure 1-1 (note: do not send bitcoin to this sample address,
      it will be lost<br>
      forever).<br>
      8<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 1: Introduction<br>
      Figure 1-1. The Mycelium Mobile Wallet<br>
      The most important part of this screen is Alice’s bitcoin address. On the
      screen it<br>
      appears as a long string of letters and numbers: 1Cdid9KFAaatwczBwBttQcw<br>
      XYCpvK8h7FK. Next to the wallet’s bitcoin address is a QR code, a form of
      barcode that<br>
      contains the same information in a format that can be scanned by a
      smartphone cam‐<br>
      era. The QR code is the square with a pattern of black and white dots.
      Alice can copy<br>
      the bitcoin address or the QR code onto her clipboard by tapping the QR
      code, or the<br>
      Receive button. In most wallets, tapping the QR code will also magnify it,
      so that it<br>
      can be more easily scanned by a smartphone camera.<br>
      Getting Started<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;9<br>
      Bitcoin addresses start with a 1 or 3. Like email addresses, they can<br>
      be shared with other bitcoin users who can use them to send bit‐<br>
      coin directly to your wallet. There is nothing sensitive, from a secu‐<br>
      rity perspective, about the bitcoin address. It can be posted<br>
      anywhere without risking the security of the account. Unlike email<br>
      addresses, you can create new addresses as often as you like, all of<br>
      which will direct funds to your wallet. In fact, many modern wal‐<br>
      lets automatically create a new address for every transaction to<br>
      maximize privacy. A wallet is simply a collection of addresses and<br>
      the keys that unlock the funds within.<br>
      Alice is now ready to receive funds. Her wallet application randomly
      generated a pri‐<br>
      vate key (described in more detail in “Private Keys” on page 58) together
      with its cor‐<br>
      responding bitcoin address. At this point, her bitcoin address is not
      known to the<br>
      bitcoin network or “registered” with any part of the bitcoin system. Her
      bitcoin<br>
      address is simply a number that corresponds to a key that she can use to
      control<br>
      access to the funds. It was generated independently by her wallet without
      reference or<br>
      registration with any service. In fact, in most wallets, there is no
      association between<br>
      the bitcoin address and any externally identifiable information including
      the user’s<br>
      identity. Until the moment this address is referenced as the recipient of
      value in a<br>
      transaction posted on the bitcoin ledger, the bitcoin address is simply
      part of the vast<br>
      number of possible addresses that are valid in bitcoin. Only once it has
      been associ‐<br>
      ated with a transaction does it become part of the known addresses in the
      network.<br>
      Alice is now ready to start using her new bitcoin wallet.<br>
      Getting Your First Bitcoin<br>
      The first and often most difficult task for new users is to acquire some
      bitcoin. Unlike<br>
      other foreign currencies, you cannot yet buy bitcoin at a bank or foreign
      exchange<br>
      kiosk.<br>
      Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. Most electronic payment networks
      such as credit<br>
      cards, debit cards, PayPal, and bank account transfers are reversible. For
      someone<br>
      selling bitcoin, this difference introduces a very high risk that the
      buyer will reverse<br>
      the electronic payment after they have received bitcoin, in effect
      defrauding the seller.<br>
      To mitigate this risk, companies accepting traditional electronic payments
      in return<br>
      for bitcoin usually require buyers to undergo identity verification and
      credit-<br>
      worthiness checks, which may take several days or weeks. As a new user,
      this means<br>
      you cannot buy bitcoin instantly with a credit card. With a bit of
      patience and crea‐<br>
      tive thinking, however, you won’t need to.<br>
      10<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 1: Introduction<br>
      Here are some methods for getting bitcoin as a new user:<br>
      • Find a friend who has bitcoin and buy some from him or her directly.
      Many bit‐<br>
      coin users start this way. This method is the least complicated. One way
      to meet<br>
      people with bitcoin is to attend a local bitcoin meetup listed at
      Meetup.com.<br>
      • Use a classified service such as localbitcoins.com to find a seller in
      your area to<br>
      buy bitcoin for cash in an in-person transaction.<br>
      • Earn bitcoin by selling a product or service for bitcoin. If you are a
      programmer,<br>
      sell your programming skills. If you’re a hairdresser, cut hair for
      bitcoin.<br>
      • Use a bitcoin ATM in your city. A bitcoin ATM is a machine that accepts
      cash<br>
      and sends bitcoin to your smartphone bitcoin wallet. Find a bitcoin ATM
      close to<br>
      you using an online map from Coin ATM Radar.<br>
      • Use a bitcoin currency exchange linked to your bank account. Many
      countries<br>
      now have currency exchanges that offer a market for buyers and sellers to
      swap<br>
      bitcoin with local currency. Exchange-rate listing services, such as
      BitcoinAver‐<br>
      age, often show a list of bitcoin exchanges for each currency.<br>
      One of the advantages of bitcoin over other payment systems is<br>
      that, when used correctly, it affords users much more privacy.<br>
      Acquiring, holding, and spending bitcoin does not require you to<br>
      divulge sensitive and personally identifiable information to third<br>
      parties. However, where bitcoin touches traditional systems, such<br>
      as currency exchanges, national and international regulations often<br>
      apply. In order to exchange bitcoin for your national currency, you<br>
      will often be required to provide proof of identity and banking<br>
      information. Users should be aware that once a bitcoin address is<br>
      attached to an identity, all associated bitcoin transactions are also<br>
      easy to identify and track. This is one reason many users choose to<br>
      maintain dedicated exchange accounts unlinked to their wallets.<br>
      Alice was introduced to bitcoin by a friend so she has an easy way to
      acquire her first<br>
      bitcoin. Next, we will look at how she buys bitcoin from her friend Joe
      and how Joe<br>
      sends the bitcoin to her wallet.<br>
      Finding the Current Price of Bitcoin<br>
      Before Alice can buy bitcoin from Joe, they have to agree on the exchange
      rate<br>
      between bitcoin and US dollars. This brings up a common question for those
      new to<br>
      bitcoin: “Who sets the bitcoin price?” The short answer is that the price
      is set by mar‐<br>
      kets.<br>
      Getting Started<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;11<br>
      Bitcoin, like most other currencies, has a floating exchange rate. That
      means that the<br>
      value of bitcoin vis-a-vis any other currency fluctuates according to
      supply and<br>
      demand in the various markets where it is traded. For example, the “price”
      of bitcoin<br>
      in US dollars is calculated in each market based on the most recent trade
      of bitcoin<br>
      and US dollars. As such, the price tends to fluctuate minutely several
      times per sec‐<br>
      ond. A pricing service will aggregate the prices from several markets and
      calculate a<br>
      volume-weighted average representing the broad market exchange rate of a
      currency<br>
      pair (e.g., BTC/USD).<br>
      There are hundreds of applications and websites that can provide the
      current market<br>
      rate. Here are some of the most popular:<br>
      Bitcoin Average<br>
      A site that provides a simple view of the volume-weighted-average for each
      cur‐<br>
      rency.<br>
      CoinCap<br>
      A service listing the market capitalization and exchange rates of hundreds
      of<br>
      crypto-currencies, including bitcoin.<br>
      Chicago Mercantile Exchange Bitcoin Reference Rate<br>
      A reference rate that can be used for institutional and contractual
      reference, pro‐<br>
      vided as part of investment data feeds by the CME.<br>
      In addition to these various sites and applications, most bitcoin wallets
      will automati‐<br>
      cally convert amounts between bitcoin and other currencies. Joe will use
      his wallet to<br>
      convert the price automatically before sending bitcoin to Alice.<br>
      Sending and Receiving Bitcoin<br>
      Alice has decided to exchange $10 US dollars for bitcoin, so as not to
      risk too much<br>
      money on this new technology. She gives Joe $10 in cash, opens her
      Mycelium wallet<br>
      application, and selects Receive. This displays a QR code with Alice’s
      first bitcoin<br>
      address.<br>
      Joe then selects Send on his smartphone wallet and is presented with a
      screen con‐<br>
      taining two inputs:<br>
      • A destination bitcoin address<br>
      • The amount to send, in bitcoin (BTC) or his local currency (USD)<br>
      In the input field for the bitcoin address, there is a small icon that
      looks like a QR<br>
      code. This allows Joe to scan the barcode with his smartphone camera so
      that he<br>
      doesn’t have to type in Alice’s bitcoin address, which is quite long and
      difficult to<br>
      type. Joe taps the QR code icon and activates the smartphone camera,
      scanning the<br>
      QR code displayed on Alice’s smartphone.<br>
      12<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 1: Introduction<br>
      Joe now has Alice’s bitcoin address set as the recipient. Joe enters the
      amount as $10<br>
      US dollars and his wallet converts it by accessing the most recent
      exchange rate from<br>
      an online service. The exchange rate at the time is $100 US dollars per
      bitcoin, so $10<br>
      US dollars is worth 0.10 bitcoin (BTC), or 100 millibitcoin (mBTC) as
      shown in the<br>
      screenshot from Joe’s wallet (see Figure 1-2).<br>
      Figure 1-2. Airbitz mobile bitcoin wallet send screen<br>
      Joe then carefully checks to make sure he has entered the correct amount,
      because he<br>
      is about to transmit money and mistakes are irreversible. After
      double-checking the<br>
      address and amount, he presses Send to transmit the transaction. Joe’s
      mobile bitcoin<br>
      wallet constructs a transaction that assigns 0.10 BTC to the address
      provided by<br>
      Alice, sourcing the funds from Joe’s wallet and signing the transaction
      with Joe’s pri‐<br>
      vate keys. This tells the bitcoin network that Joe has authorized a
      transfer of value to<br>
      Alice’s new address. As the transaction is transmitted via the
      peer-to-peer protocol, it<br>
      quickly propagates across the bitcoin network. In less than a second, most
      of the well-<br>
      connected nodes in the network receive the transaction and see Alice’s
      address for the<br>
      first time.<br>
      Meanwhile, Alice’s wallet is constantly “listening” to published
      transactions on the<br>
      bitcoin network, looking for any that match the addresses in her wallets.
      A few sec‐<br>
      Getting Started<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;13<br>
      onds after Joe’s wallet transmits the transaction, Alice’s wallet will
      indicate that it is<br>
      receiving 0.10 BTC.<br>
      Confirmations<br>
      At first, Alice’s address will show the transaction from Joe as
      “Unconfirmed.” This<br>
      means that the transaction has been propagated to the network but has not
      yet been<br>
      recorded in the bitcoin transaction ledger, known as the blockchain. To be
      confirmed,<br>
      a transaction must be included in a block and added to the blockchain,
      which hap‐<br>
      pens every 10 minutes, on average. In traditional financial terms this is
      known as<br>
      clearing. For more details on propagation, validation, and clearing
      (confirmation) of<br>
      bitcoin transactions, see Chapter 10.<br>
      Alice is now the proud owner of 0.10 BTC that she can spend. In the next
      chapter we<br>
      will look at her first purchase with bitcoin, and examine the underlying
      transaction<br>
      and propagation technologies in more detail.<br>

      CHAPTER 2<br>
      How Bitcoin Works<br>
      Transactions, Blocks, Mining, and the Blockchain<br>
      The bitcoin system, unlike traditional banking and payment systems, is
      based on<br>
      decentralized trust. Instead of a central trusted authority, in bitcoin,
      trust is achieved<br>
      as an emergent property from the interactions of different participants in
      the bitcoin<br>
      system. In this chapter, we will examine bitcoin from a high level by
      tracking a single<br>
      transaction through the bitcoin system and watch as it becomes “trusted”
      and<br>
      accepted by the bitcoin mechanism of distributed consensus and is finally
      recorded<br>
      on the blockchain, the distributed ledger of all transactions. Subsequent
      chapters will<br>
      delve into the technology behind transactions, the network, and mining.<br>
      Bitcoin Overview<br>
      In the overview diagram shown in Figure 2-1, we see that the bitcoin
      system consists<br>
      of users with wallets containing keys, transactions that are propagated
      across the net‐<br>
      work, and miners who produce (through competitive computation) the
      consensus<br>
      blockchain, which is the authoritative ledger of all transactions.<br>
      Each example in this chapter is based on an actual transaction made on the
      bitcoin<br>
      network, simulating the interactions between the users (Joe, Alice, Bob,
      and Gopesh)<br>
      by sending funds from one wallet to another. While tracking a transaction
      through<br>
      the bitcoin network to the blockchain, we will use a blockchain explorer
      site to visual‐<br>
      ize each step. A blockchain explorer is a web application that operates as
      a bitcoin<br>
      search engine, in that it allows you to search for addresses,
      transactions, and blocks<br>
      and see the relationships and flows between them.<br>
      15<br>
      Figure 2-1. Bitcoin overview<br>
      Popular blockchain explorers include:<br>
      • Bitcoin Block Explorer<br>
      • BlockCypher Explorer<br>
      • blockchain.info<br>
      • BitPay Insight<br>
      Each of these has a search function that can take a bitcoin address,
      transaction hash,<br>
      block number, or block hash and retrieve corresponding information from
      the bit‐<br>
      coin network. With each transaction or block example, we will provide a
      URL so you<br>
      can look it up yourself and study it in detail.<br>
      Buying a Cup of Coffee<br>
      Alice, introduced in the previous chapter, is a new user who has just
      acquired her first<br>
      bitcoin. In “Getting Your First Bitcoin” on page 10, Alice met with her
      friend Joe to<br>
      exchange some cash for bitcoin. The transaction created by Joe funded
      Alice’s wallet<br>
      with 0.10 BTC. Now Alice will make her first retail transaction, buying a
      cup of coffee<br>
      at Bob’s coffee shop in Palo Alto, California.<br>
      Bob’s Cafe recently started accepting bitcoin payments by adding a bitcoin
      option to<br>
      its point-of-sale system. The prices at Bob’s Cafe are listed in the local
      currency (US<br>
      dollars), but at the register, customers have the option of paying in
      either dollars or<br>
      bitcoin. Alice places her order for a cup of coffee and Bob enters it into
      the register, as<br>
      16<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 2: How Bitcoin Works<br>
      he does for all transactions. The point-of-sale system automatically
      converts the total<br>
      price from US dollars to bitcoin at the prevailing market rate and
      displays the price in<br>
      both currencies:<br>
      Total:<br>
      $1.50 USD<br>
      0.015 BTC<br>
      Bob says, “That’s one-dollar-fifty, or fifteen millibits.”<br>
      Bob’s point-of-sale system will also automatically create a special QR
      code containing<br>
      a payment request (see Figure 2-2).<br>
      Unlike a QR code that simply contains a destination bitcoin address, a
      payment<br>
      request is a QR-encoded URL that contains a destination address, a payment
      amount,<br>
      and a generic description such as “Bob’s Cafe.” This allows a bitcoin
      wallet application<br>
      to prefill the information used to send the payment while showing a
      human-readable<br>
      description to the user. You can scan the QR code with a bitcoin wallet
      application to<br>
      see what Alice would see.<br>

      Alice uses her smartphone to scan the barcode on display. Her smartphone
      shows a<br>
      payment of 0.0150 BTC to Bob’s Cafe and she selects Send to authorize the
      payment.<br>
      Within a few seconds (about the same amount of time as a credit card
      authorization),<br>
      Bob sees the transaction on the register, completing the transaction.<br>
      In the following sections we will examine this transaction in more detail.
      We’ll see<br>
      how Alice’s wallet constructed it, how it was propagated across the
      network, how it<br>
      was verified, and finally, how Bob can spend that amount in subsequent
      transactions.<br>
      The bitcoin network can transact in fractional values, e.g., from<br>
      millibitcoin (1/1000th of a bitcoin) down to 1/100,000,000th of a<br>
      bitcoin, which is known as a satoshi. Throughout this book we’ll<br>
      use the term “bitcoin” to refer to any quantity of bitcoin currency,<br>
      from the smallest unit (1 satoshi) to the total number (21,000,000)<br>
      of all bitcoin that will ever be mined.<br>
      You can examine Alice’s transaction to Bob’s Cafe on the blockchain using
      a block<br>
      explorer site (Example 2-1):<br>

      Bitcoin Transactions<br>
      In simple terms, a transaction tells the network that the owner of some
      bitcoin value<br>
      has authorized the transfer of that value to another owner. The new owner
      can now<br>
      spend the bitcoin by creating another transaction that authorizes transfer
      to another<br>
      owner, and so on, in a chain of ownership.<br>
      Transaction Inputs and Outputs<br>
      Transactions are like lines in a double-entry bookkeeping ledger. Each
      transaction<br>
      contains one or more “inputs,” which are like debits against a bitcoin
      account. On the<br>
      other side of the transaction, there are one or more “outputs,” which are
      like credits<br>
      added to a bitcoin account. The inputs and outputs (debits and credits) do
      not neces‐<br>
      sarily add up to the same amount. Instead, outputs add up to slightly less
      than inputs<br>
      and the difference represents an implied transaction fee, which is a small
      payment col‐<br>
      lected by the miner who includes the transaction in the ledger. A bitcoin
      transaction<br>
      is shown as a bookkeeping ledger entry in Figure 2-3.<br>
      The transaction also contains proof of ownership for each amount of
      bitcoin (inputs)<br>
      whose value is being spent, in the form of a digital signature from the
      owner, which<br>
      18<br>
      &nbsp;| Chapter 2: How Bitcoin Works<br>
      can be independently validated by anyone. In bitcoin terms, “spending” is
      signing a<br>
      transaction that transfers value from a previous transaction over to a new
      owner<br>
      identified by a bitcoin address.<br>
      Figure 2-3. Transaction as double-entry bookkeeping<br>
      Transaction Chains<br>
      Alice’s payment to Bob’s Cafe uses a previous transaction’s output as its
      input. In the<br>
      previous chapter, Alice received bitcoin from her friend Joe in return for
      cash. That<br>
      transaction created a bitcoin value locked by Alice’s key. Her new
      transaction to Bob’s<br>
      Cafe references the previous transaction as an input and creates new
      outputs to pay<br>
      for the cup of coffee and receive change. The transactions form a chain,
      where the<br>
      inputs from the latest transaction correspond to outputs from previous
      transactions.<br>
      Alice’s key provides the signature that unlocks those previous transaction
      outputs,<br>
      thereby proving to the bitcoin network that she owns the funds. She
      attaches the pay‐<br>
      ment for coffee to Bob’s address, thereby “encumbering” that output with
      the require‐<br>
      ment that Bob produces a signature in order to spend that amount. This
      represents a<br>
      transfer of value between Alice and Bob. This chain of transactions, from
      Joe to Alice<br>
      to Bob, is illustrated in Figure 2-4.<br>
      Bitcoin Transactions<br>

      &nbsp;19<br>
      Figure 2-4. A chain of transactions, where the output of one transaction
      is the input of<br>
      the next transaction<br>
      Making Change<br>
      Many bitcoin transactions will include outputs that reference both an
      address of the<br>
      new owner and an address of the current owner, called the change address.
      This is<br>
      because transaction inputs, like currency notes, cannot be divided. If you
      purchase a<br>
      $5 US dollar item in a store but use a $20 US dollar bill to pay for the
      item, you expect<br>
      to receive $15 US dollars in change. The same concept applies with bitcoin
      transac‐<br>
      tion inputs. If you purchased an item that costs 5 bitcoin but only had a
      20 bitcoin<br>
      input to use, you would send one output of 5 bitcoin to the store owner
      and one out‐<br>
      put of 15 bitcoin back to yourself as change (less any applicable
      transaction fee).<br>
      Importantly, the change address does not have to be the same address as
      that of the<br>
      input and for privacy reasons is often a new address from the owner’s
      wallet.<br>
      Different wallets may use different strategies when aggregating inputs to
      make a pay‐<br>
      ment requested by the user. They might aggregate many small inputs, or use
      one that<br>
      is equal to or larger than the desired payment. Unless the wallet can
      aggregate inputs<br>
      in such a way to exactly match the desired payment plus transaction fees,
      the wallet<br>
      will need to generate some change. This is very similar to how people
      handle cash. If<br>
      you always use the largest bill in your pocket, you will end up with a
      pocket full of<br>
      loose change. If you only use the loose change, you’ll always have only
      big bills. Peo‐<br>
      ple subconsciously find a balance between these two extremes, and bitcoin
      wallet<br>
      developers strive to program this balance.<br>
      20<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 2: How Bitcoin Works<br>
      In summary, transactions move value from transaction inputs to transaction
      outputs.<br>
      An input is a reference to a previous transaction’s output, showing where
      the value is<br>
      coming from. A transaction output directs a specific value to a new
      owner’s bitcoin<br>
      address and can include a change output back to the original owner.
      Outputs from<br>
      one transaction can be used as inputs in a new transaction, thus creating
      a chain of<br>
      ownership as the value is moved from owner to owner (see Figure 2-4).<br>
      Common Transaction Forms<br>
      The most common form of transaction is a simple payment from one address
      to<br>
      another, which often includes some “change” returned to the original
      owner. This<br>
      type of transaction has one input and two outputs and is shown in Figure
      2-5.<br>
      Figure 2-5. Most common transaction<br>
      Another common form of transaction is one that aggregates several inputs
      into a sin‐<br>
      gle output (see Figure 2-6). This represents the real-world equivalent of
      exchanging a<br>
      pile of coins and currency notes for a single larger note. Transactions
      like these are<br>
      sometimes generated by wallet applications to clean up lots of smaller
      amounts that<br>
      were received as change for payments.<br>
      Figure 2-6. Transaction aggregating funds<br>
      Bitcoin Transactions<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;21<br>
      Finally, another transaction form that is seen often on the bitcoin ledger
      is a transac‐<br>
      tion that distributes one input to multiple outputs representing multiple
      recipients<br>
      (see Figure 2-7). This type of transaction is sometimes used by commercial
      entities to<br>
      distribute funds, such as when processing payroll payments to multiple
      employees.<br>
      Figure 2-7. Transaction distributing funds<br>
      Constructing a Transaction<br>
      Alice’s wallet application contains all the logic for selecting
      appropriate inputs and<br>
      outputs to build a transaction to Alice’s specification. Alice only needs
      to specify a<br>
      destination and an amount, and the rest happens in the wallet application
      without her<br>
      seeing the details. Importantly, a wallet application can construct
      transactions even if<br>
      it is completely offline. Like writing a check at home and later sending
      it to the bank<br>
      in an envelope, the transaction does not need to be constructed and signed
      while con‐<br>
      nected to the bitcoin network.<br>
      Getting the Right Inputs<br>
      Alice’s wallet application will first have to find inputs that can pay for
      the amount she<br>
      wants to send to Bob. Most wallets keep track of all the available outputs
      belonging to<br>
      addresses in the wallet. Therefore, Alice’s wallet would contain a copy of
      the transac‐<br>
      tion output from Joe’s transaction, which was created in exchange for cash
      (see “Get‐<br>
      ting Your First Bitcoin” on page 10). A bitcoin wallet application that
      runs as a full-<br>
      node client actually contains a copy of every unspent output from every
      transaction<br>
      in the blockchain. This allows a wallet to construct transaction inputs as
      well as<br>
      quickly verify incoming transactions as having correct inputs. However,
      because a<br>
      full-node client takes up a lot of disk space, most user wallets run
      “lightweight” clients<br>
      that track only the user’s own unspent outputs.<br>
      If the wallet application does not maintain a copy of unspent transaction
      outputs, it<br>
      can query the bitcoin network to retrieve this information using a variety
      of APIs<br>
      available by different providers or by asking a full-node using an
      application pro‐<br>
      22<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 2: How Bitcoin Works<br>
      gramming interface (API) call. Example 2-2 shows a API request,
      constructed as an<br>
      HTTP GET command to a specific URL. This URL will return all the unspent
      trans‐<br>
      action outputs for an address, giving any application the information it
      needs to con‐<br>
      struct transaction inputs for spending. We use the simple command-line
      HTTP client<br>
      cURL to retrieve the response.<br>
      Example 2-2. Look up all the unspent outputs for Alice’s bitcoin address<br>
      $ curl
      https://blockchain.info/unspent?active=1Cdid9KFAaatwczBwBttQcwXYCpvK8h7FK<br>
      {<br>
      "unspent_outputs":[<br>
      {<br>
      "tx_hash":"186f9f998a5...2836dd734d2804fe65fa35779",<br>

      "value_hex": "00989680",<br>
      "confirmations":0<br>
      }<br>
      ]<br>
      }<br>
      The response in Example 2-2 shows one unspent output (one that has not
      been<br>
      redeemed yet) under the ownership of Alice’s address
      1Cdid9KFAaatwczBwBttQcw<br>
      XYCpvK8h7FK. The response includes the reference to the transaction in
      which this<br>
      unspent output is contained (the payment from Joe) and its value in
      satoshis, at 10<br>
      million, equivalent to 0.10 bitcoin. With this information, Alice’s wallet
      application<br>
      can construct a transaction to transfer that value to new owner addresses.<br>
      View the transaction from Joe to Alice.<br>
      As you can see, Alice’s wallet contains enough bitcoin in a single unspent
      output to<br>
      pay for the cup of coffee. Had this not been the case, Alice’s wallet
      application might<br>
      have to “rummage” through a pile of smaller unspent outputs, like picking
      coins from<br>
      a purse until it could find enough to pay for the coffee. In both cases,
      there might be a<br>
      need to get some change back, which we will see in the next section, as
      the wallet<br>
      application creates the transaction outputs (payments).<br>
      Constructing a Transaction<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;23<br>
      Creating the Outputs<br>
      A transaction output is created in the form of a script that creates an
      encumbrance on<br>
      the value and can only be redeemed by the introduction of a solution to
      the script. In<br>
      simpler terms, Alice’s transaction output will contain a script that says
      something like,<br>
      “This output is payable to whoever can present a signature from the key
      correspond‐<br>
      ing to Bob’s public address.” Because only Bob has the wallet with the
      keys corre‐<br>
      sponding to that address, only Bob’s wallet can present such a signature
      to redeem<br>
      this output. Alice will therefore “encumber” the output value with a
      demand for a sig‐<br>
      nature from Bob.<br>
      This transaction will also include a second output, because Alice’s funds
      are in the<br>
      form of a 0.10 BTC output, too much money for the 0.015 BTC cup of coffee.
      Alice<br>
      will need 0.085 BTC in change. Alice’s change payment is created by
      Alice’s wallet as<br>
      an output in the very same transaction as the payment to Bob. Essentially,
      Alice’s wal‐<br>
      let breaks her funds into two payments: one to Bob and one back to
      herself. She can<br>
      then use (spend) the change output in a subsequent transaction.<br>
      Finally, for the transaction to be processed by the network in a timely
      fashion, Alice’s<br>
      wallet application will add a small fee. This is not explicit in the
      transaction; it is<br>
      implied by the difference between inputs and outputs. If instead of taking
      0.085 in<br>
      change, Alice creates only 0.0845 as the second output, there will be
      0.0005 BTC (half<br>
      a millibitcoin) left over. The input’s 0.10 BTC is not fully spent with
      the two outputs,<br>
      because they will add up to less than 0.10. The resulting difference is
      the transaction<br>
      fee that is collected by the miner as a fee for validating and including
      the transaction<br>
      in a block to be recorded on the blockchain.<br>
      The resulting transaction can be seen using a blockchain explorer web
      application, as<br>
      shown in Figure 2-8.<br>
      Figure 2-8. Alice’s transaction to Bob’s Cafe<br>
      24<br>
      &nbsp;| Chapter 2: How Bitcoin Works<br>
      View the transaction from Alice to Bob’s Cafe.<br>
      Adding the Transaction to the Ledger<br>
      The transaction created by Alice’s wallet application is 258 bytes long
      and contains<br>
      everything necessary to confirm ownership of the funds and assign new
      owners.<br>
      Now, the transaction must be transmitted to the bitcoin network where it
      will become<br>
      part of the blockchain. In the next section we will see how a transaction
      becomes part<br>
      of a new block and how the block is “mined.” Finally, we will see how the
      new block,<br>
      once added to the blockchain, is increasingly trusted by the network as
      more blocks<br>
      are added.<br>
      Transmitting the transaction<br>
      Because the transaction contains all the information necessary to process,
      it does not<br>
      matter how or where it is transmitted to the bitcoin network. The bitcoin
      network is a<br>
      peer-to-peer network, with each bitcoin client participating by connecting
      to several<br>
      other bitcoin clients. The purpose of the bitcoin network is to propagate
      transactions<br>
      and blocks to all participants.<br>
      How it propagates<br>
      Any system, such as a server, desktop application, or wallet, that
      participates in the<br>
      bitcoin network by “speaking” the bitcoin protocol is called a bitcoin
      node. Alice’s wal‐<br>
      let application can send the new transaction to any bitcoin node it is
      connected to<br>
      over any type of connection: wired, WiFi, mobile, etc. Her bitcoin wallet
      does not<br>
      have to be connected to Bob’s bitcoin wallet directly and she does not
      have to use the<br>
      internet connection offered by the cafe, though both those options are
      possible, too.<br>
      Any bitcoin node that receives a valid transaction it has not seen before
      will immedi‐<br>
      ately forward it to all other nodes to which it is connected, a
      propagation technique<br>
      known as flooding. Thus, the transaction rapidly propagates out across the
      peer-to-<br>
      peer network, reaching a large percentage of the nodes within a few
      seconds.<br>
      Bob’s view<br>
      If Bob’s bitcoin wallet application is directly connected to Alice’s
      wallet application,<br>
      Bob’s wallet application might be the first node to receive the
      transaction. However,<br>
      even if Alice’s wallet sends the transaction through other nodes, it will
      reach Bob’s<br>
      wallet within a few seconds. Bob’s wallet will immediately identify
      Alice’s transaction<br>
      as an incoming payment because it contains outputs redeemable by Bob’s
      keys. Bob’s<br>
      wallet application can also independently verify that the transaction is
      well formed,<br>
      Constructing a Transaction<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;25<br>
      uses previously unspent inputs, and contains sufficient transaction fees
      to be included<br>
      in the next block. At this point Bob can assume, with little risk, that
      the transaction<br>
      will shortly be included in a block and confirmed.<br>
      A common misconception about bitcoin transactions is that they<br>
      must be “confirmed” by waiting 10 minutes for a new block, or up<br>
      to 60 minutes for a full six confirmations. Although confirmations<br>
      ensure the transaction has been accepted by the whole network,<br>
      such a delay is unnecessary for small-value items such as a cup of<br>
      coffee. A merchant may accept a valid small-value transaction with<br>
      no confirmations, with no more risk than a credit card payment<br>
      made without an ID or a signature, as merchants routinely accept<br>
      today.<br>
      Bitcoin Mining<br>
      Alice’s transaction is now propagated on the bitcoin network. It does not
      become part<br>
      of the blockchain until it is verified and included in a block by a
      process called mining.<br>
      See Chapter 10 for a detailed explanation.<br>
      The bitcoin system of trust is based on computation. Transactions are
      bundled into<br>
      blocks, which require an enormous amount of computation to prove, but only
      a small<br>
      amount of computation to verify as proven. The mining process serves two
      purposes<br>
      in bitcoin:<br>
      • Mining nodes validate all transactions by reference to bitcoin’s
      consensus rules.<br>
      Therefore, mining provides security for bitcoin transactions by rejecting
      invalid<br>
      or malformed transactions.<br>
      • Mining creates new bitcoin in each block, almost like a central bank
      printing new<br>
      money. The amount of bitcoin created per block is limited and diminishes
      with<br>
      time, following a fixed issuance schedule.<br>
      Mining achieves a fine balance between cost and reward. Mining uses
      electricity to<br>
      solve a mathematical problem. A successful miner will collect a reward in
      the form of<br>
      new bitcoin and transaction fees. However, the reward will only be
      collected if the<br>
      miner has correctly validated all the transactions, to the satisfaction of
      the rules of<br>
      consensus. This delicate balance provides security for bitcoin without a
      central<br>
      authority.<br>
      A good way to describe mining is like a giant competitive game of sudoku
      that resets<br>
      every time someone finds a solution and whose difficulty automatically
      adjusts so<br>
      that it takes approximately 10 minutes to find a solution. Imagine a giant
      sudoku puz‐<br>
      zle, several thousand rows and columns in size. If I show you a completed
      puzzle you<br>
      can verify it quite quickly. However, if the puzzle has a few squares
      filled and the rest<br>
      26<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 2: How Bitcoin Works<br>
      are empty, it takes a lot of work to solve! The difficulty of the sudoku
      can be adjusted<br>
      by changing its size (more or fewer rows and columns), but it can still be
      verified<br>
      quite easily even if it is very large. The “puzzle” used in bitcoin is
      based on a crypto‐<br>
      graphic hash and exhibits similar characteristics: it is asymmetrically
      hard to solve<br>
      but easy to verify, and its difficulty can be adjusted.<br>
      In “Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories” on page 5, we introduced Jing,
      an entre‐<br>
      preneur in Shanghai. Jing runs a mining farm, which is a business that
      runs thousands<br>
      of specialized mining computers, competing for the reward. Every 10
      minutes or so,<br>
      Jing’s mining computers compete against thousands of similar systems in a
      global<br>
      race to find a solution to a block of transactions. Finding such a
      solution, the so-<br>
      called Proof-of-Work (PoW), requires quadrillions of hashing operations
      per second<br>
      across the entire bitcoin network. The algorithm for Proof-of-Work
      involves repeat‐<br>
      edly hashing the header of the block and a random number with the SHA256
      crypto‐<br>
      graphic algorithm until a solution matching a predetermined pattern
      emerges. The<br>
      first miner to find such a solution wins the round of competition and
      publishes that<br>
      block into the blockchain.<br>
      Jing started mining in 2010 using a very fast desktop computer to find a
      suitable<br>
      Proof-of-Work for new blocks. As more miners started joining the bitcoin
      network,<br>
      the difficulty of the problem increased rapidly. Soon, Jing and other
      miners upgraded<br>
      to more specialized hardware, such as high-end dedicated graphical
      processing units<br>
      (GPUs) cards such as those used in gaming desktops or consoles. At the
      time of this<br>
      writing, the difficulty is so high that it is profitable only to mine with
      application-<br>
      specific integrated circuits (ASIC), essentially hundreds of mining
      algorithms printed<br>
      in hardware, running in parallel on a single silicon chip. Jing’s company
      also partici‐<br>
      pates in a mining pool, which much like a lottery pool allows several
      participants to<br>
      share their efforts and rewards. Jing’s company now runs a warehouse
      containing<br>
      thousands of ASIC miners to mine for bitcoin 24 hours a day. The company
      pays its<br>
      electricity costs by selling the bitcoin it is able to generate from
      mining, creating some<br>
      income from the profits.<br>
      Mining Transactions in Blocks<br>
      New transactions are constantly flowing into the network from user wallets
      and other<br>
      applications. As these are seen by the bitcoin network nodes, they get
      added to a tem‐<br>
      porary pool of unverified transactions maintained by each node. As miners
      construct<br>
      a new block, they add unverified transactions from this pool to the new
      block and<br>
      then attempt to prove the validity of that new block, with the mining
      algorithm<br>
      (Proof-of-Work). The process of mining is explained in detail in Chapter
      10.<br>
      Transactions are added to the new block, prioritized by the highest-fee
      transactions<br>
      first and a few other criteria. Each miner starts the process of mining a
      new block of<br>
      transactions as soon as he receives the previous block from the network,
      knowing he<br>
      Mining Transactions in Blocks<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;27<br>
      has lost that previous round of competition. He immediately creates a new
      block, fills<br>
      it with transactions and the fingerprint of the previous block, and starts
      calculating<br>
      the Proof-of-Work for the new block. Each miner includes a special
      transaction in his<br>
      block, one that pays his own bitcoin address the block reward (currently
      12.5 newly<br>
      created bitcoin) plus the sum of transaction fees from all the
      transactions included in<br>
      the block. If he finds a solution that makes that block valid, he “wins”
      this reward<br>
      because his successful block is added to the global blockchain and the
      reward transac‐<br>
      tion he included becomes spendable. Jing, who participates in a mining
      pool, has set<br>
      up his software to create new blocks that assign the reward to a pool
      address. From<br>
      there, a share of the reward is distributed to Jing and other miners in
      proportion to<br>
      the amount of work they contributed in the last round.<br>
      Alice’s transaction was picked up by the network and included in the pool
      of unveri‐<br>
      fied transactions. Once validated by the mining software it was included
      in a new<br>
      block, called a candidate block, generated by Jing’s mining pool. All the
      miners partici‐<br>
      pating in that mining pool immediately start computing Proof-of-Work for
      the can‐<br>
      didate block. Approximately five minutes after the transaction was first
      transmitted<br>
      by Alice’s wallet, one of Jing’s ASIC miners found a solution for the
      candidate block<br>
      and announced it to the network. Once other miners validated the winning
      block<br>
      they started the race to generate the next block.<br>
      Jing’s winning block became part of the blockchain as block #277316,
      containing 420<br>
      transactions, including Alice’s transaction. The block containing Alice’s
      transaction is<br>
      counted as one “confirmation” of that transaction.<br>
      You can see the block that includes Alice’s transaction.<br>
      Approximately 19 minutes later, a new block, #277317, is mined by another
      miner.<br>
      Because this new block is built on top of block #277316 that contained
      Alice’s transac‐<br>
      tion, it added even more computation to the blockchain, thereby
      strengthening the<br>
      trust in those transactions. Each block mined on top of the one containing
      the trans‐<br>
      action counts as an additional confirmation for Alice’s transaction. As
      the blocks pile<br>
      on top of each other, it becomes exponentially harder to reverse the
      transaction,<br>
      thereby making it more and more trusted by the network.<br>
      In the diagram in Figure 2-9, we can see block #277316, which contains
      Alice’s trans‐<br>
      action. Below it are 277,316 blocks (including block #0), linked to each
      other in a<br>
      chain of blocks (blockchain) all the way back to block #0, known as the
      genesis block.<br>
      Over time, as the “height” in blocks increases, so does the computation
      difficulty for<br>
      each block and the chain as a whole. The blocks mined after the one that
      contains<br>
      28<br>
      &nbsp;| Chapter 2: How Bitcoin Works<br>
      Alice’s transaction act as further assurance, as they pile on more
      computation in a<br>
      longer and longer chain. By convention, any block with more than six
      confirmations<br>
      is considered irrevocable, because it would require an immense amount of
      computa‐<br>
      tion to invalidate and recalculate six blocks. We will examine the process
      of mining<br>
      and the way it builds trust in more detail in Chapter 10.<br>
      Figure 2-9. Alice’s transaction included in block #277316<br>
      Spending the Transaction<br>
      Now that Alice’s transaction has been embedded in the blockchain as part
      of a block,<br>
      it is part of the distributed ledger of bitcoin and visible to all bitcoin
      applications.<br>
      Each bitcoin client can independently verify the transaction as valid and
      spendable.<br>
      Full-node clients can track the source of the funds from the moment the
      bitcoin were<br>
      first generated in a block, incrementally from transaction to transaction,
      until they<br>
      reach Bob’s address. Lightweight clients can do what is called a
      simplified payment<br>
      verification (see “Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) Nodes” on page
      183) by con‐<br>
      firming that the transaction is in the blockchain and has several blocks
      mined after it,<br>
      thus providing assurance that the miners accepted it as valid.<br>
      Bob can now spend the output from this and other transactions. For
      example, Bob<br>
      can pay a contractor or supplier by transferring value from Alice’s coffee
      cup payment<br>
      to these new owners. Most likely, Bob’s bitcoin software will aggregate
      many small<br>
      payments into a larger payment, perhaps concentrating all the day’s
      bitcoin revenue<br>
      into a single transaction. This would aggregate the various payments into
      a single<br>
      Spending the Transaction<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;29<br>
      output (and a single address). For a diagram of an aggregating
      transaction, see<br>
      Figure 2-6.<br>
      As Bob spends the payments received from Alice and other customers, he
      extends the<br>
      chain of transactions. Let’s assume that Bob pays his web designer Gopesh
      in Banga‐<br>
      lore for a new website page. Now the chain of transactions will look like
      Figure 2-10.<br>
      Figure 2-10. Alice’s transaction as part of a transaction chain from Joe
      to Gopesh<br>
      In this chapter, we saw how transactions build a chain that moves value
      from owner<br>
      to owner. We also tracked Alice’s transaction, from the moment it was
      created in her<br>
      wallet, through the bitcoin network and to the miners who recorded it on
      the block‐<br>
      chain. In the rest of this book we will examine the specific technologies
      behind wal‐<br>
      lets, addresses, signatures, transactions, the network, and finally
      mining.<br>

      CHAPTER 3<br>
      Bitcoin Core: The Reference<br>
      Implementation<br>
      Bitcoin is an open source project and the source code is available under
      an open<br>
      (MIT) license, free to download and use for any purpose. Open source means
      more<br>
      than simply free to use. It also means that bitcoin is developed by an
      open commu‐<br>
      nity of volunteers. At first, that community consisted of only Satoshi
      Nakamoto. By<br>
      2016, bitcoin’s source code had more than 400 contributors with about a
      dozen devel‐<br>
      opers working on the code almost full-time and several dozen more on a
      part-time<br>
      basis. Anyone can contribute to the code—including you!<br>
      When bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, the software was actually
      completed<br>
      before the whitepaper reproduced in Appendix A was written. Satoshi wanted
      to<br>
      make sure it worked before writing about it. That first implementation,
      then simply<br>
      known as “Bitcoin” or “Satoshi client,” has been heavily modified and
      improved. It has<br>
      evolved into what is known as Bitcoin Core, to differentiate it from other
      compatible<br>
      implementations. Bitcoin Core is the reference implementation of the
      bitcoin system,<br>
      meaning that it is the authoritative reference on how each part of the
      technology<br>
      should be implemented. Bitcoin Core implements all aspects of bitcoin,
      including<br>
      wallets, a transaction and block validation engine, and a full network
      node in the<br>
      peer-to-peer bitcoin network.<br>
      Even though Bitcoin Core includes a reference implementation of a<br>
      wallet, this is not intended to be used as a production wallet for<br>
      users or for applications. Application developers are advised to<br>
      build wallets using modern standards such as BIP-39 and BIP-32<br>
      (see “Mnemonic Code Words (BIP-39)” on page 99 and “HD Wal‐<br>
      lets (BIP-32/BIP-44)” on page 96). BIP stands for Bitcoin Improve‐<br>
      ment Proposal.<br>

      Download ZIP from the sidebar. Alternatively, use the git command line to
      create a<br>
      local copy of the source code on your system.<br>
      In many of the examples in this chapter we will be using the oper‐<br>
      ating system’s command-line interface (also known as a “shell”),<br>
      accessed via a “terminal” application. The shell will display a<br>
      prompt; you type a command; and the shell responds with some<br>
      text and a new prompt for your next command. The prompt may<br>
      look different on your system, but in the following examples it is<br>
      denoted by a $ symbol. In the examples, when you see text after a $<br>
      symbol, don’t type the $ symbol but type the command immedi‐<br>
      ately following it, then press Enter to execute the command. In the<br>
      examples, the lines below each command are the operating system’s<br>
      responses to that command. When you see the next $ prefix, you’ll<br>
      know it’s a new command and you should repeat the process.<br>
      In this example, we are using the git command to create a local copy
      (“clone”) of the<br>
      source code:<br>
      $ git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git<br>

      Git is the most widely used distributed version control system, an<br>
      essential part of any software developer’s toolkit. You may need to<br>
      install the git command, or a graphical user interface for git, on<br>
      your operating system if you do not have it already.<br>
      When the git cloning operation has completed, you will have a complete
      local copy of<br>
      the source code repository in the directory bitcoin. Change to this
      directory by typing<br>
      cd bitcoin at the prompt:<br>
      $ cd bitcoin<br>
      Selecting a Bitcoin Core Release<br>
      By default, the local copy will be synchronized with the most recent code,
      which<br>
      might be an unstable or beta version of bitcoin. Before compiling the
      code, select a<br>
      specific version by checking out a release tag. This will synchronize the
      local copy<br>
      with a specific snapshot of the code repository identified by a keyword

      configuration flags, but you should review them to understand what
      optional features<br>
      are part of the client. If you are in an academic setting, computer lab
      restrictions may<br>
      require you to install applications in your home directory (e.g., using
      --prefix=<br>
      $HOME).<br>
      Here are some useful options that override the default behavior of the
      configure<br>
      script:<br>
      --prefix=$HOME<br>
      This overrides the default installation location (which is /usr/local/)
      for the<br>
      resulting executable. Use $HOME to put everything in your home directory,
      or a<br>
      different path.<br>
      --disable-wallet<br>
      This is used to disable the reference wallet implementation.<br>
      --with-incompatible-bdb<br>

      the<br>
      Berkeley DB library.<br>

      Don’t build the graphical user interface, which requires the Qt library.
      This builds<br>
      server and command-line bitcoin only.<br>
      Next, run the configure script to automatically discover all the necessary
      libraries<br>
      and create a customized build script for your system:<br>
      $ ./configure<br>
      checking build system type... x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu<br>
      checking host system type... x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu<br>
      checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c<br>
      checking whether build environment is sane... yes<br>
      checking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... /bin/mkdir -p<br>
      checking for gawk... gawk<br>
      checking whether make sets $(MAKE)... yes<br>
      ...<br>
      [many pages of configuration tests follow]<br>
      ...<br>
      $<br>
      If all went well, the configure command will end by creating the
      customized build<br>
      scripts that will allow us to compile bitcoind. If there are any missing
      libraries or<br>
      errors, the configure command will terminate with an error instead of
      creating the<br>
      build scripts. If an error occurs, it is most likely because of a missing
      or incompatible<br>
      library. Review the build documentation again and make sure you install
      the missing<br>
      prerequisites. Then run configure again and see if that fixes the error.<br>

      should add<br>
      bitcoin to the startup scripts in your operating system, so that it runs
      continuously<br>

      Bitcoin Core Application Programming Interface (API)<br>
      The Bitcoin Core client implements a JSON-RPC interface that can also be
      accessed<br>
      using the command-line helper bitcoin-cli. The command line allows us to
      experi‐<br>
      ment interactively with the capabilities that are also available
      programmatically via<br>
      the API. To start, invoke the help command to see a list of the available
      bitcoin RPC<br>
      commands:<br>

      Each of these commands may take a number of parameters. To get additional
      help, a<br>
      detailed description, and information on the parameters, add the command
      name<br>
      after help. For example, to see help on the getblockhash RPC command:<br>
      $ bitcoin-cli help getblockhash<br>
      getblockhash index<br>
      Returns hash of block in best-block-chain at index provided.<br>
      Arguments:<br>
      1. index<br>
      (numeric, required) The block index<br>
      Result:<br>
      "hash"<br>
      (string) The block hash<br>
      Examples:<br>
      &gt; bitcoin-cli getblockhash 1000<br>
      &gt; curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0",
      "id":"curltest",<br>
      "method": "getblockhash", "params": [1000] }' -H 'content-type:
      text/plain;'<br>
      http://127.0.0.1:8332/<br>
      At the end of the help information you will see two examples of the RPC
      command,<br>
      using the bitcoin-cli helper or the HTTP client curl. These examples
      demonstrate<br>
      how you might call the command. Copy the first example and see the result:<br>
      $ bitcoin-cli getblockhash 1000<br>
      00000000c937983704a73af28acdec37b049d214adbda81d7e2a3dd146f6ed09<br>
      The result is a block hash, which is described in more detail in the
      following chapters.<br>
      But for now, this command should return the same result on your system,
      demon‐<br>
      strating that your Bitcoin Core node is running, is accepting commands,
      and has<br>
      information about block 1000 to return to you.<br>
      In the next sections we will demonstrate some very useful RPC commands and
      their<br>
      expected output.<br>
      Getting Information on the Bitcoin Core Client Status<br>
      Command: getinfo<br>
      Bitcoin’s getinfo RPC command displays basic information about the status
      of the<br>
      bitcoin network node, the wallet, and the blockchain database. Use
      bitcoin-cli to<br>
      run it:<br>

      It will take some time, perhaps more than a day, for the bitcoind<br>
      client to “catch up” to the current blockchain height as it down‐<br>
      loads blocks from other bitcoin clients. You can check its progress<br>
      using getinfo to see the number of known blocks.<br>
      Exploring and Decoding Transactions<br>
      Commands: getrawtransaction, decoderawtransaction<br>
      In “Buying a Cup of Coffee” on page 16, Alice bought a cup of coffee from
      Bob’s Cafe.<br>
      Her transaction was recorded on the blockchain with transaction ID (txid)<br>
      0627052b6f28912f2703066a912ea577f2ce4da4caa5a5fbd8a57286c345c2f2. Let’s
      use<br>
      the API to retrieve and examine that transaction by passing the
      transaction ID as a<br>
      parameter:<br>
      $ bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction

      A transaction ID is not authoritative until a transaction has been<br>
      confirmed. Absence of a transaction hash in the blockchain does<br>
      not mean the transaction was not processed. This is known as<br>
      “transaction malleability,” because transaction hashes can be modi‐<br>
      fied prior to confirmation in a block. After confirmation, the txid is<br>
      immutable and authoritative.<br>
      The command getrawtransaction returns a serialized transaction in
      hexadecimal<br>
      notation. To decode that, we use the decoderawtransaction command, passing
      the<br>
      hex data as a parameter. You can copy the hex returned by
      getrawtransaction and<br>
      paste it as a parameter to decoderawtransaction:<br>

      The transaction decode shows all the components of this transaction,
      including the<br>
      transaction inputs and outputs. In this case we see that the transaction
      that credited<br>
      our new address with 15 millibits used one input and generated two
      outputs. The<br>
      input to this transaction was the output from a previously confirmed
      transaction<br>
      (shown as the vin txid starting with 7957a35fe). The two outputs
      correspond to the<br>
      15 millibit credit and an output with change back to the sender.<br>
      We can further explore the blockchain by examining the previous
      transaction refer‐<br>
      enced by its txid in this transaction using the same commands (e.g.,
      getrawtransac<br>
      tion). Jumping from transaction to transaction we can follow a chain of
      transactions<br>
      back as the coins are transmitted from owner address to owner address.<br>
      Exploring Blocks<br>
      Commands: getblock, getblockhash<br>
      Exploring blocks is similar to exploring transactions. However, blocks can
      be refer‐<br>
      enced either by the block height or by the block hash. First, let’s find a
      block by its<br>
      height. In “Buying a Cup of Coffee” on page 16, we saw that Alice’s
      transaction was<br>
      included in block 277316.<br>
      We use the getblockhash command, which takes the block height as the
      parameter<br>
      and returns the block hash for that block:<br>
      $ bitcoin-cli getblockhash 277316<br>
      0000000000000001b6b9a13b095e96db41c4a928b97ef2d944a9b31b2cc7bdc4<br>
      Now that we know which block Alice’s transaction was included in, we can
      query that<br>
      block. We use the getblock command with the block hash as the parameter:<br>
      $ bitcoin-cli getblock

      The block contains 419 transactions and the 64th transaction listed
      (0627052b...) is<br>

      block in the<br>

      Using Bitcoin Core’s Programmatic Interface<br>
      The bitcoin-cli helper is very useful for exploring the Bitcoin Core API
      and testing<br>
      functions. But the whole point of an application programming interface is
      to access<br>
      functions programmatically. In this section we will demonstrate accessing
      Bitcoin<br>
      Core from another program.<br>
      Bitcoin Core’s API is a JSON-RPC interface. JSON stands for JavaScript
      Object Nota‐<br>
      tion and it is a very convenient way to present data that both humans and
      programs<br>
      48<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 3: Bitcoin Core: The Reference Implementation<br>
      can easily read. RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call, which means that we
      are call‐<br>
      ing procedures (functions) that are remote (on the Bitcoin Core node) via
      a network<br>
      protocol. In this case, the network protocol is HTTP, or HTTPS (for
      encrypted con‐<br>
      nections).<br>
      When we used the bitcoin-cli command to get help on a command, it showed
      us<br>
      an example of using curl, the versatile command-line HTTP client to
      construct one<br>
      of these JSON-RPC calls:<br>
      $ curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0",
      "id":"curltest",<br>
      "method": "getinfo", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;'
      http://<br>
      127.0.0.1:8332/<br>
      This command shows that curl submits an HTTP request to the local host<br>
      (127.0.0.1), connecting to the default bitcoin port (8332), and submitting
      a jsonrpc<br>
      request for the getinfo method using text/plain encoding.<br>
      If you’re implementing a JSON-RPC call in your own program, you can use a
      generic<br>
      HTTP library to construct the call, similar to what is shown in the
      preceding curl<br>
      example.<br>
      However, there are libraries in most every programming language that
      “wrap” the<br>
      Bitcoin Core API in a way that makes this a lot simpler. We will use the
      python-<br>
      bitcoinlib library to simplify API access. Remember, this requires you to
      have a<br>
      running Bitcoin Core instance, which will be used to make JSON-RPC calls.<br>
      The Python script in Example 3-3 makes a simple getinfo call and prints
      the block<br>
      parameter from the data returned by Bitcoin Core.<br>
      Example 3-3. Running getinfo via Bitcoin Core’s JSON-RPC API<br>
      from bitcoin.rpc import RawProxy<br>
      # Create a connection to local Bitcoin Core node<br>
      p = RawProxy()<br>
      # Run the getinfo command, store the resulting data in info<br>
      info = p.getinfo()<br>
      # Retrieve the 'blocks' element from the info<br>
      print(info['blocks'])<br>
      Running it gives us the following result:<br>
      $ python rpc_example.py<br>
      394075<br>
      Bitcoin Core Application Programming Interface (API)<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;49<br>
      It tells us that our local Bitcoin Core node has 394075 blocks in its
      blockchain. Not a<br>
      spectacular result, but it demonstrates the basic use of the library as a
      simplified<br>
      interface to Bitcoin Core’s JSON-RPC API.<br>
      Next, let’s use the getrawtransaction and decodetransaction calls to
      retrieve the<br>
      details of Alice’s coffee payment. In Example 3-4, we retrieve Alice’s
      transaction and<br>
      list the transaction’s outputs. For each output, we show the recipient
      address and<br>
      value. As a reminder, Alice’s transaction had one output paying Bob’s Cafe
      and one<br>
      output for change back to Alice.<br>
      Example 3-4. Retrieving a transaction and iterating its outputs<br>
      from bitcoin.rpc import RawProxy<br>
      p = RawProxy()<br>
      # Alice's transaction ID<br>
      txid = "0627052b6f28912f2703066a912ea577f2ce4da4caa5a5fbd8a57286c345c2f2"<br>
      # First, retrieve the raw transaction in hex<br>
      raw_tx = p.getrawtransaction(txid)<br>
      # Decode the transaction hex into a JSON object<br>
      decoded_tx = p.decoderawtransaction(raw_tx)<br>
      # Retrieve each of the outputs from the transaction<br>
      for output in decoded_tx['vout']:<br>
      print(output['scriptPubKey']['addresses'], output['value'])<br>
      Running this code, we get:<br>
      $ python rpc_transaction.py<br>
      ([u'1GdK9UzpHBzqzX2A9JFP3Di4weBwqgmoQA'], Decimal('0.01500000'))<br>
      ([u'1Cdid9KFAaatwczBwBttQcwXYCpvK8h7FK'], Decimal('0.08450000'))<br>
      Both of the preceding examples are rather simple. You don’t really need a
      program to<br>
      run them; you could just as easily use the bitcoin-cli helper. The next
      example,<br>
      however, requires several hundred RPC calls and more clearly demonstrates
      the use<br>
      of a programmatic interface.<br>
      In Example 3-5, we first retrieve block 277316, then retrieve each of the
      419 transac‐<br>
      tions within by reference to each transaction ID. Next, we iterate through
      each of the<br>
      transaction’s outputs and add up the value.<br>
      Example 3-5. Retrieving a block and adding all the transaction outputs<br>
      from bitcoin.rpc import RawProxy<br>
      p = RawProxy()<br>
      50<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 3: Bitcoin Core: The Reference Implementation<br>
      # The block height where Alice's transaction was recorded<br>
      blockheight = 277316<br>
      # Get the block hash of block with height 277316<br>
      blockhash = p.getblockhash(blockheight)<br>
      # Retrieve the block by its hash<br>
      block = p.getblock(blockhash)<br>
      # Element tx contains the list of all transaction IDs in the block<br>
      transactions = block['tx']<br>
      block_value = 0<br>
      # Iterate through each transaction ID in the block<br>
      for txid in transactions:<br>
      tx_value = 0<br>
      # Retrieve the raw transaction by ID<br>
      raw_tx = p.getrawtransaction(txid)<br>
      # Decode the transaction<br>
      decoded_tx = p.decoderawtransaction(raw_tx)<br>
      # Iterate through each output in the transaction<br>
      for output in decoded_tx['vout']:<br>
      # Add up the value of each output<br>
      tx_value = tx_value + output['value']<br>
      # Add the value of this transaction to the total<br>
      block_value = block_value + tx_value<br>
      print("Total value in block: ", block_value)<br>
      Running this code, we get:<br>
      $ python rpc_block.py<br>
      ('Total value in block: ', Decimal('10322.07722534'))<br>
      Our example code calculates that the total value transacted in this block
      is<br>
      10,322.07722534 BTC (including 25 BTC reward and 0.0909 BTC in fees).

      Addresses<br>
      You may have heard that bitcoin is based on cryptography, which is a
      branch of math‐<br>
      ematics used extensively in computer security. Cryptography means “secret
      writing”<br>
      in Greek, but the science of cryptography encompasses more than just
      secret writing,<br>
      which is referred to as encryption. Cryptography can also be used to prove
      knowl‐<br>
      edge of a secret without revealing that secret (digital signature), or
      prove the authen‐<br>
      ticity of data (digital fingerprint). These types of cryptographic proofs
      are the<br>
      mathematical tools critical to bitcoin and used extensively in bitcoin
      applications.<br>
      Ironically, encryption is not an important part of bitcoin, as its
      communications and<br>
      transaction data are not encrypted and do not need to be encrypted to
      protect the<br>
      funds. In this chapter we will introduce some of the cryptography used in
      bitcoin to<br>
      control ownership of funds, in the form of keys, addresses, and wallets.<br>
      Introduction<br>
      Ownership of bitcoin is established through digital keys, bitcoin
      addresses, and digital<br>
      signatures. The digital keys are not actually stored in the network, but
      are instead cre‐<br>
      ated and stored by users in a file, or simple database, called a wallet.
      The digital keys<br>
      in a user’s wallet are completely independent of the bitcoin protocol and
      can be gen‐<br>
      erated and managed by the user’s wallet software without reference to the
      blockchain<br>
      or access to the internet. Keys enable many of the interesting properties
      of bitcoin,<br>
      including decentralized trust and control, ownership attestation, and the<br>
      cryptographic-proof security model.<br>
      Most bitcoin transactions requires a valid digital signature to be
      included in the<br>
      blockchain, which can only be generated with a secret key; therefore,
      anyone with a<br>
      copy of that key has control of the bitcoin. The digital signature used to
      spend funds<br>
      is also referred to as a witness, a term used in cryptography. The witness
      data in a bit‐<br>
      coin transaction testifies to the true ownership of the funds being spent.<br>
      55<br>
      Keys come in pairs consisting of a private (secret) key and a public key.
      Think of the<br>
      public key as similar to a bank account number and the private key as
      similar to the<br>
      secret PIN, or signature on a check, that provides control over the
      account. These<br>
      digital keys are very rarely seen by the users of bitcoin. For the most
      part, they are<br>
      stored inside the wallet file and managed by the bitcoin wallet software.<br>
      In the payment portion of a bitcoin transaction, the recipient’s public
      key is repre‐<br>
      sented by its digital fingerprint, called a bitcoin address, which is used
      in the same way<br>
      as the beneficiary name on a check (i.e., “Pay to the order of ”). In most
      cases, a bit‐<br>
      coin address is generated from and corresponds to a public key. However,
      not all bit‐<br>
      coin addresses represent public keys; they can also represent other
      beneficiaries such<br>
      as scripts, as we will see later in this chapter. This way, bitcoin
      addresses abstract the<br>
      recipient of funds, making transaction destinations flexible, similar to
      paper checks: a<br>
      single payment instrument that can be used to pay into people’s accounts,
      pay into<br>
      company accounts, pay for bills, or pay to cash. The bitcoin address is
      the only repre‐<br>
      sentation of the keys that users will routinely see, because this is the
      part they need to<br>
      share with the world.<br>
      First, we will introduce cryptography and explain the mathematics used in
      bitcoin.<br>
      Next, we will look at how keys are generated, stored, and managed. We will
      review the<br>
      various encoding formats used to represent private and public keys,
      addresses, and<br>
      script addresses. Finally, we will look at advanced use of keys and
      addresses: vanity,<br>
      multisignature, and script addresses and paper wallets.<br>
      Public Key Cryptography and Cryptocurrency<br>
      Public key cryptography was invented in the 1970s and is a mathematical
      foundation<br>
      for computer and information security.<br>
      Since the invention of public key cryptography, several suitable
      mathematical func‐<br>
      tions, such as prime number exponentiation and elliptic curve
      multiplication, have<br>
      been discovered. These mathematical functions are practically
      irreversible, meaning<br>
      that they are easy to calculate in one direction and infeasible to
      calculate in the oppo‐<br>
      site direction. Based on these mathematical functions, cryptography
      enables the cre‐<br>
      ation of digital secrets and unforgeable digital signatures. Bitcoin uses
      elliptic curve<br>
      multiplication as the basis for its cryptography.<br>
      In bitcoin, we use public key cryptography to create a key pair that
      controls access to<br>
      bitcoin. The key pair consists of a private key and—derived from it—a
      unique public<br>
      key. The public key is used to receive funds, and the private key is used
      to sign trans‐<br>
      actions to spend the funds.<br>
      There is a mathematical relationship between the public and the private
      key that<br>
      allows the private key to be used to generate signatures on messages. This
      signature<br>
      can be validated against the public key without revealing the private key.<br>
      56<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 4: Keys, Addresses<br>
      When spending bitcoin, the current bitcoin owner presents her public key
      and a sig‐<br>
      nature (different each time, but created from the same private key) in a
      transaction to<br>
      spend those bitcoin. Through the presentation of the public key and
      signature, every‐<br>
      one in the bitcoin network can verify and accept the transaction as valid,
      confirming<br>
      that the person transferring the bitcoin owned them at the time of the
      transfer.<br>
      In most wallet implementations, the private and public keys are<br>
      stored together as a key pair for convenience. However, the public<br>
      key can be calculated from the private key, so storing only the pri‐<br>
      vate key is also possible.<br>
      Private and Public Keys<br>
      A bitcoin wallet contains a collection of key pairs, each consisting of a
      private key and<br>
      a public key. The private key (k) is a number, usually picked at random.
      From the pri‐<br>
      vate key, we use elliptic curve multiplication, a one-way cryptographic
      function, to<br>
      generate a public key (K). From the public key (K), we use a one-way
      cryptographic<br>
      hash function to generate a bitcoin address (A). In this section, we will
      start with gen‐<br>
      erating the private key, look at the elliptic curve math that is used to
      turn that into a<br>
      public key, and finally, generate a bitcoin address from the public key.
      The relation‐<br>
      ship between private key, public key, and bitcoin address is shown in
      Figure 4-1.<br>
      Figure 4-1. Private key, public key, and bitcoin address<br>
      Why Use Asymmetric Cryptography (Public/Private Keys)?<br>
      Why is asymmetric cryptography used in bitcoin? It’s not used to “encrypt”
      (make<br>
      secret) the transactions. Rather, the useful property of asymmetric
      cryptography is the<br>
      ability to generate digital signatures. A private key can be applied to
      the digital finger‐<br>
      print of a transaction to produce a numerical signature. This signature
      can only be<br>
      produced by someone with knowledge of the private key. However, anyone
      with<br>
      access to the public key and the transaction fingerprint can use them to
      verify the sig‐<br>
      nature. This useful property of asymmetric cryptography makes it possible
      for anyone<br>
      to verify every signature on every transaction, while ensuring that only
      the owners of<br>
      private keys can produce valid signatures.<br>
      Introduction<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;57<br>
      Private Keys<br>
      A private key is simply a number, picked at random. Ownership and control
      over the<br>
      private key is the root of user control over all funds associated with the
      corresponding<br>
      bitcoin address. The private key is used to create signatures that are
      required to spend<br>
      bitcoin by proving ownership of funds used in a transaction. The private
      key must<br>
      remain secret at all times, because revealing it to third parties is
      equivalent to giving<br>
      them control over the bitcoin secured by that key. The private key must
      also be<br>
      backed up and protected from accidental loss, because if it’s lost it
      cannot be recov‐<br>
      ered and the funds secured by it are forever lost, too.<br>
      The bitcoin private key is just a number. You can pick your private<br>
      keys randomly using just a coin, pencil, and paper: toss a coin 256<br>
      times and you have the binary digits of a random private key you<br>
      can use in a bitcoin wallet. The public key can then be generated<br>
      from the private key.<br>
      Generating a private key from a random number<br>
      The first and most important step in generating keys is to find a secure
      source of<br>
      entropy, or randomness. Creating a bitcoin key is essentially the same as
      “Pick a num‐<br>
      ber between 1 and 2256.” The exact method you use to pick that number does
      not mat‐<br>
      ter as long as it is not predictable or repeatable. Bitcoin software uses
      the underlying<br>
      operating system’s random number generators to produce 256 bits of entropy
      (ran‐<br>
      domness). Usually, the OS random number generator is initialized by a
      human source<br>
      of randomness, which is why you may be asked to wiggle your mouse around
      for a<br>
      few seconds.<br>
      More precisely, the private key can be any number between 1 and n - 1,
      where n is a<br>
      constant (n = 1.158 * 1077, slightly less than 2256) defined as the order
      of the elliptic<br>
      curve used in bitcoin (see “Elliptic Curve Cryptography Explained” on page
      60). To<br>
      create such a key, we randomly pick a 256-bit number and check that it is
      less than n<br>
      - 1 . In programming terms, this is usually achieved by feeding a larger
      string of ran‐<br>
      dom bits, collected from a cryptographically secure source of randomness,
      into the<br>
      SHA256 hash algorithm, which will conveniently produce a 256-bit number.
      If the<br>
      result is less than n - 1, we have a suitable private key. Otherwise, we
      simply try<br>
      again with another random number.<br>
      58<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 4: Keys, Addresses<br>
      Do not write your own code to create a random number or use a<br>
      “simple” random number generator offered by your programming<br>
      language. Use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number<br>
      generator (CSPRNG) with a seed from a source of sufficient<br>
      entropy. Study the documentation of the random number genera‐<br>
      tor library you choose to make sure it is cryptographically secure.<br>
      Correct implementation of the CSPRNG is critical to the security<br>
      of the keys.<br>
      The following is a randomly generated private key (k) shown in hexadecimal
      format<br>
      (256 bits shown as 64 hexadecimal digits, each 4 bits):<br>

      The size of bitcoin’s private key space, (2256) is an unfathomably<br>
      large number. It is approximately 1077 in decimal. For comparison,<br>
      the visible universe is estimated to contain 1080 atoms.<br>
      To generate a new key with the Bitcoin Core client (see Chapter 3), use
      the getnewad<br>
      dress command. For security reasons it displays the public key only, not
      the private<br>
      key. To ask bitcoind to expose the private key, use the dumpprivkey
      command. The<br>
      dumpprivkey command shows the private key in a Base58 checksum-encoded
      format<br>
      called the Wallet Import Format (WIF), which we will examine in more
      detail in “Pri‐<br>
      vate key formats” on page 70. Here’s an example of generating and
      displaying a pri‐<br>
      vate key using these two commands:<br>
      $ bitcoin-cli getnewaddress<br>
      1J7mdg5rbQyUHENYdx39WVWK7fsLpEoXZy<br>
      $ bitcoin-cli dumpprivkey 1J7mdg5rbQyUHENYdx39WVWK7fsLpEoXZy<br>
      KxFC1jmwwCoACiCAWZ3eXa96mBM6tb3TYzGmf6YwgdGWZgawvrtJ<br>
      The dumpprivkey command opens the wallet and extracts the private key that
      was<br>
      generated by the getnewaddress command. It is not possible for bitcoind to
      know<br>
      the private key from the public key unless they are both stored in the
      wallet.<br>
      The dumpprivkey command does not generate a private key from a<br>
      public key, as this is impossible. The command simply reveals the<br>
      private key that is already known to the wallet and which was gen‐<br>
      erated by the getnewaddress command.<br>
      Introduction<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;59<br>
      You can also use the Bitcoin Explorer command-line tool (see Appendix G)
      to gener‐<br>
      ate and display private keys with the commands seed, ec-new, and
      ec-to-wif:<br>

      Public Keys<br>
      The public key is calculated from the private key using elliptic curve
      multiplication,<br>
      which is irreversible: K = k * G, where k is the private key, G is a
      constant point called<br>
      the generator point, and K is the resulting public key. The reverse
      operation, known as<br>
      “finding the discrete logarithm”—calculating k if you know K—is as
      difficult as trying<br>
      all possible values of k, i.e., a brute-force search. Before we
      demonstrate how to gen‐<br>
      erate a public key from a private key, let’s look at elliptic curve
      cryptography in a bit<br>
      more detail.<br>
      Elliptic curve multiplication is a type of function that cryptogra‐<br>
      phers call a “trap door” function: it is easy to do in one direction<br>
      (multiplication) and impossible to do in the reverse direction (divi‐<br>
      sion). The owner of the private key can easily create the public key<br>
      and then share it with the world knowing that no one can reverse<br>
      the function and calculate the private key from the public key. This<br>
      mathematical trick becomes the basis for unforgeable and secure<br>
      digital signatures that prove ownership of bitcoin funds.<br>
      Elliptic Curve Cryptography Explained<br>
      Elliptic curve cryptography is a type of asymmetric or public key
      cryptography based<br>
      on the discrete logarithm problem as expressed by addition and
      multiplication on the<br>
      points of an elliptic curve.<br>
      Figure 4-2 is an example of an elliptic curve, similar to that used by
      bitcoin.<br>
      Figure 4-2. An elliptic curve<br>
      60<br>
      &nbsp;| Chapter 4: Keys, Addresses<br>
      Bitcoin uses a specific elliptic curve and set of mathematical constants,
      as defined in a<br>
      standard called secp256k1, established by the National Institute of
      Standards and<br>
      Technology (NIST). The secp256k1 curve is defined by the following
      function, which<br>
      produces an elliptic curve:<br>
      y2 = x3 + 7 over � p<br>
      or<br>
      y2 mod p = x3 + 7 mod p<br>
      The mod p (modulo prime number p) indicates that this curve is over a
      finite field of<br>
      prime order p, also written as � p, where p = 2256 – 232 – 29 – 28 – 27 –
      2 6 – 24 – 1, a very<br>
      large prime number.<br>
      Because this curve is defined over a finite field of prime order instead
      of over the real<br>
      numbers, it looks like a pattern of dots scattered in two dimensions,
      which makes it<br>
      difficult to visualize. However, the math is identical to that of an
      elliptic curve over<br>
      real numbers. As an example, Figure 4-3 shows the same elliptic curve over
      a much<br>
      smaller finite field of prime order 17, showing a pattern of dots on a
      grid. The<br>
      secp256k1 bitcoin elliptic curve can be thought of as a much more complex
      pattern<br>
      of dots on a unfathomably large grid.<br>

      represented by<br>
      x = y = 0 (which doesn’t satisfy the elliptic curve equation, but it’s an
      easy separate<br>
      case that can be checked).<br>
      There is also a + operator, called “addition,” which has some properties
      similar to the<br>
      traditional addition of real numbers that gradeschool children learn.
      Given two<br>
      points P1 and P2 on the elliptic curve, there is a third point P3 = P1 +
      P2, also on the<br>
      elliptic curve.<br>
      Geometrically, this third point P3 is calculated by drawing a line between
      P1 and P2.<br>
      This line will intersect the elliptic curve in exactly one additional
      place. Call this point<br>
      P3' = (x, y). Then reflect in the x-axis to get P3 = (x, –y).<br>
      There are a couple of special cases that explain the need for the “point
      at infinity.”<br>
      If P1 and P2 are the same point, the line “between” P1 and P2 should
      extend to be the<br>
      tangent on the curve at this point P1. This tangent will intersect the
      curve in exactly<br>
      one new point. You can use techniques from calculus to determine the slope
      of the<br>
      tangent line. These techniques curiously work, even though we are
      restricting our<br>
      interest to points on the curve with two integer coordinates!<br>
      In some cases (i.e., if P1 and P2 have the same x values but different y
      values), the tan‐<br>
      gent line will be exactly vertical, in which case P3 = “point at
      infinity.”<br>
      62<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 4: Keys, Addresses<br>
      If P1 is the “point at infinity,” then P1 + P2 = P2. Similarly, if P2 is
      the point at infinity,<br>
      then P1 + P2 = P1. This shows how the point at infinity plays the role of
      zero.<br>
      It turns out that + is associative, which means that (A + B) + C = A + (B
      + C). That<br>
      means we can write A + B + C without parentheses and without ambiguity.<br>
      Now that we have defined addition, we can define multiplication in the
      standard way<br>
      that extends addition. For a point P on the elliptic curve, if k is a
      whole number, then<br>
      kP = P + P + P + ... + P (k times). Note that k is sometimes confusingly
      called an<br>
      “exponent” in this case.<br>
      Generating a Public Key<br>
      Starting with a private key in the form of a randomly generated number k,
      we multi‐<br>
      ply it by a predetermined point on the curve called the generator point G
      to produce<br>
      another point somewhere else on the curve, which is the corresponding
      public key K.<br>
      The generator point is specified as part of the secp256k1 standard and is
      always the<br>
      same for all keys in bitcoin:<br>
      K = k * G<br>
      where k is the private key, G is the generator point, and K is the
      resulting public key, a<br>
      point on the curve. Because the generator point is always the same for all
      bitcoin<br>
      users, a private key k multiplied with G will always result in the same
      public key K.<br>
      The relationship between k and K is fixed, but can only be calculated in
      one direction,<br>
      from k to K. That’s why a bitcoin address (derived from K) can be shared
      with anyone<br>
      and does not reveal the user’s private key (k).<br>
      A private key can be converted into a public key, but a public key<br>
      cannot be converted back into a private key because the math only<br>
      works one way.<br>
      Implementing the elliptic curve multiplication, we take the private key k
      generated<br>
      previously and multiply it with the generator point G to find the public
      key K:<br>
      K = 1E99423A4ED27608A15A2616A2B0E9E52CED330AC530EDCC32C8FFC6A526AEDD * G<br>

      K = (x, y)<br>
      where,<br>
      x = F028892BAD7ED57D2FB57BF33081D5CFCF6F9ED3D3D7F159C2E2FFF579DC341A<br>

      Introduction<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;63<br>
      To visualize multiplication of a point with an integer, we will use the
      simpler elliptic<br>
      curve over real numbers—remember, the math is the same. Our goal is to
      find the<br>
      multiple kG of the generator point G, which is the same as adding G to
      itself, k times<br>
      in a row. In elliptic curves, adding a point to itself is the equivalent
      of drawing a tan‐<br>
      gent line on the point and finding where it intersects the curve again,
      then reflecting<br>
      that point on the x-axis.<br>
      Figure 4-4 shows the process for deriving G, 2G, 4G, as a geometric
      operation on the<br>
      curve.<br>
      Most bitcoin implementations use the OpenSSL cryptographic<br>
      library to do the elliptic curve math. For example, to derive the<br>
      public key, the function EC_POINT_mul() is used.<br>

      a point G by an<br>

      Bitcoin Addresses<br>
      A bitcoin address is a string of digits and characters that can be shared
      with anyone<br>
      who wants to send you money. Addresses produced from public keys consist
      of a<br>
      string of numbers and letters, beginning with the digit “1.” Here’s an
      example of a bit‐<br>
      coin address:<br>
      64<br>
      &nbsp;| Chapter 4: Keys, Addresses<br>
      1J7mdg5rbQyUHENYdx39WVWK7fsLpEoXZy<br>
      The bitcoin address is what appears most commonly in a transaction as the
      “recipi‐<br>
      ent” of the funds. If we compare a bitcoin transaction to a paper check,
      the bitcoin<br>
      address is the beneficiary, which is what we write on the line after “Pay
      to the order<br>
      of.” On a paper check, that beneficiary can sometimes be the name of a
      bank account<br>
      holder, but can also include corporations, institutions, or even cash.
      Because paper<br>
      checks do not need to specify an account, but rather use an abstract name
      as the<br>
      recipient of funds, they are very flexible payment instruments. Bitcoin
      transactions<br>
      use a similar abstraction, the bitcoin address, to make them very
      flexible. A bitcoin<br>
      address can represent the owner of a private/public key pair, or it can
      represent some‐<br>
      thing else, such as a payment script, as we will see in
      “Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH)” on<br>
      page 151. For now, let’s examine the simple case, a bitcoin address that
      represents,<br>
      and is derived from, a public key.<br>
      The bitcoin address is derived from the public key through the use of
      one-way cryp‐<br>
      tographic hashing. A “hashing algorithm” or simply “hash algorithm” is a
      one-way<br>
      function that produces a fingerprint or “hash” of an arbitrary-sized
      input. Crypto‐<br>
      graphic hash functions are used extensively in bitcoin: in bitcoin
      addresses, in script<br>
      addresses, and in the mining Proof-of-Work algorithm. The algorithms used
      to make<br>
      a bitcoin address from a public key are the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)
      and the<br>
      RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest (RIPEMD), specifically<br>
      SHA256 and RIPEMD160.<br>
      Starting with the public key K, we compute the SHA256 hash and then
      compute the<br>
      RIPEMD160 hash of the result, producing a 160-bit (20-byte) number:<br>
      A = RIPEMD160 SHA256 K<br>
      where K is the public key and A is the resulting bitcoin address.<br>
      A bitcoin address is not the same as a public key. Bitcoin addresses<br>
      are derived from a public key using a one-way function.<br>
      Bitcoin addresses are almost always encoded as “Base58Check” (see “Base58
      and<br>
      Base58Check Encoding” on page 66), which uses 58 characters (a Base58
      number sys‐<br>
      tem) and a checksum to help human readability, avoid ambiguity, and
      protect against<br>
      errors in address transcription and entry. Base58Check is also used in
      many other<br>
      ways in bitcoin, whenever there is a need for a user to read and correctly
      transcribe a<br>
      number, such as a bitcoin address, a private key, an encrypted key, or a
      script hash. In<br>
      the next section we will examine the mechanics of Base58Check encoding and
      decod‐<br>

      ing and the resulting representations. Figure 4-5 illustrates the
      conversion of a public<br>
      key into a bitcoin address.<br>

      Base58 and Base58Check Encoding<br>
      In order to represent long numbers in a compact way, using fewer symbols,
      many<br>
      computer systems use mixed-alphanumeric representations with a base (or
      radix)<br>
      higher than 10. For example, whereas the traditional decimal system uses
      the 10<br>
      numerals 0 through 9, the hexadecimal system uses 16, with the letters A
      through F as<br>
      the six additional symbols. A number represented in hexadecimal format is
      shorter<br>
      than the equivalent decimal representation. Even more compact, Base64
      representa‐<br>
      tion uses 26 lowercase letters, 26 capital letters, 10 numerals, and 2
      more characters<br>
      66<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 4: Keys, Addresses<br>
      such as “+” and “/” to transmit binary data over text-based media such as
      email.<br>
      Base64 is most commonly used to add binary attachments to email. Base58 is
      a text-<br>
      based binary-encoding format developed for use in bitcoin and used in many
      other<br>
      cryptocurrencies. It offers a balance between compact representation,
      readability, and<br>
      error detection and prevention. Base58 is a subset of Base64, using upper-
      and lower‐<br>
      case letters and numbers, but omitting some characters that are frequently
      mistaken<br>
      for one another and can appear identical when displayed in certain fonts.
      Specifically,<br>
      Base58 is Base64 without the 0 (number zero), O (capital o), l (lower L),
      I (capital i),<br>
      and the symbols “+” and “/”. Or, more simply, it is a set of lowercase and
      capital letters<br>
      and numbers without the four (0, O, l, I) just mentioned. Example 4-2
      shows the full<br>
      Base58 alphabet.<br>
      Example 4-2. Bitcoin’s Base58 alphabet<br>
      123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz<br>
      To add extra security against typos or transcription errors, Base58Check
      is a Base58<br>
      encoding format, frequently used in bitcoin, which has a built-in
      error-checking<br>
      code. The checksum is an additional four bytes added to the end of the
      data that is<br>
      being encoded. The checksum is derived from the hash of the encoded data
      and can<br>
      therefore be used to detect and prevent transcription and typing errors.
      When pre‐<br>
      sented with Base58Check code, the decoding software will calculate the
      checksum of<br>
      the data and compare it to the checksum included in the code. If the two
      do not<br>
      match, an error has been introduced and the Base58Check data is invalid.
      This pre‐<br>
      vents a mistyped bitcoin address from being accepted by the wallet
      software as a valid<br>
      destination, an error that would otherwise result in loss of funds.<br>
      To convert data (a number) into a Base58Check format, we first add a
      prefix to the<br>
      data, called the “version byte,” which serves to easily identify the type
      of data that is<br>
      encoded. For example, in the case of a bitcoin address the prefix is zero
      (0x00 in hex),<br>
      whereas the prefix used when encoding a private key is 128 (0x80 in hex).
      A list of<br>
      common version prefixes is shown in Table 4-1.<br>
      Next, we compute the “double-SHA” checksum, meaning we apply the SHA256
      hash-<br>
      algorithm twice on the previous result (prefix and data):<br>
      checksum = SHA256(SHA256(prefix+data))<br>
      From the resulting 32-byte hash (hash-of-a-hash), we take only the first
      four bytes.<br>
      These four bytes serve as the error-checking code, or checksum. The
      checksum is<br>
      concatenated (appended) to the end.<br>
      The result is composed of three items: a prefix, the data, and a checksum.
      This result<br>
      is encoded using the Base58 alphabet described previously. Figure 4-6
      illustrates the<br>
      Base58Check encoding process.<br>

      format for<br>
      unambiguously encoding bitcoin data<br>
      In bitcoin, most of the data presented to the user is Base58Check-encoded
      to make it<br>
      compact, easy to read, and easy to detect errors. The version prefix in
      Base58Check<br>
      encoding is used to create easily distinguishable formats, which when
      encoded in<br>
      Base58 contain specific characters at the beginning of the
      Base58Check-encoded pay‐<br>
      load. These characters make it easy for humans to identify the type of
      data that is<br>
      encoded and how to use it. This is what differentiates, for example, a
      Base58Check-<br>
      encoded bitcoin address that starts with a 1 from a Base58Check-encoded
      private key<br>
      WIF that starts with a 5. Some example version prefixes and the resulting

      Here’s the same public key generated previously, shown as a compressed
      public key<br>
      stored in 264 bits (66 hex digits) with the prefix 03 indicating the y
      coordinate is odd:<br>

      This compressed public key corresponds to the same private key, meaning it
      is gener‐<br>
      ated from the same private key. However, it looks different from the
      uncompressed<br>
      public key. More importantly, if we convert this compressed public key to
      a bitcoin<br>
      address using the double-hash function (RIPEMD160(SHA256(K))) it will
      produce a<br>
      different bitcoin address. This can be confusing, because it means that a
      single private<br>
      key can produce a public key expressed in two different formats
      (compressed and<br>
      uncompressed) that produce two different bitcoin addresses. However, the
      private<br>
      key is identical for both bitcoin addresses.<br>
      Compressed public keys are gradually becoming the default across bitcoin
      clients,<br>
      which is having a significant impact on reducing the size of transactions
      and there‐<br>
      fore the blockchain. However, not all clients support compressed public

      Advanced Keys and Addresses<br>
      In the following sections we will look at advanced forms of keys and
      addresses, such<br>
      as encrypted private keys, script and multisignature addresses, vanity
      addresses, and<br>
      paper wallets.<br>
      Encrypted Private Keys (BIP-38)<br>
      Private keys must remain secret. The need for confidentiality of the
      private keys is a<br>
      truism that is quite difficult to achieve in practice, because it
      conflicts with the equally<br>
      important security objective of availability. Keeping the private key
      private is much<br>
      harder when you need to store backups of the private key to avoid losing
      it. A private<br>
      key stored in a wallet that is encrypted by a password might be secure,
      but that wallet<br>
      needs to be backed up. At times, users need to move keys from one wallet
      to another<br>
      —to upgrade or replace the wallet software, for example. Private key
      backups might<br>
      also be stored on paper (see “Paper Wallets” on page 88) or on external
      storage media,<br>
      such as a USB flash drive. But what if the backup itself is stolen or
      lost? These con‐<br>
      flicting security goals led to the introduction of a portable and
      convenient standard<br>
      for encrypting private keys in a way that can be understood by many
      different wallets<br>
      and bitcoin clients, standardized by BIP-38 (see Appendix C).<br>
      BIP-38 proposes a common standard for encrypting private keys with a
      passphrase<br>
      and encoding them with Base58Check so that they can be stored securely on
      backup<br>
      media, transported securely between wallets, or kept in any other
      conditions where<br>
      the key might be exposed. The standard for encryption uses the Advanced
      Encryp‐<br>
      tion Standard (AES), a standard established by the NIST and used broadly
      in data<br>
      encryption implementations for commercial and military applications.<br>
      A BIP-38 encryption scheme takes as input a bitcoin private key, usually
      encoded in<br>
      the WIF, as a Base58Check string with the prefix of “5.” Additionally, the
      BIP-38<br>
      encryption scheme takes a passphrase—a long password—usually composed of
      sev‐<br>
      80<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 4: Keys, Addresses<br>
      eral words or a complex string of alphanumeric characters. The result of
      the BIP-38<br>
      encryption scheme is a Base58Check-encoded encrypted private key that
      begins with<br>
      the prefix 6P. If you see a key that starts with 6P, it is encrypted and
      requires a pass‐<br>
      phrase in order to convert (decrypt) it back into a WIF-formatted private
      key (prefix<br>
      5) that can be used in any wallet. Many wallet applications now recognize
      BIP-38-<br>
      encrypted private keys and will prompt the user for a passphrase to
      decrypt and<br>
      import the key. Third-party applications, such as the incredibly useful
      browser-based<br>
      Bit Address (Wallet Details tab), can be used to decrypt BIP-38 keys.<br>
      The most common use case for BIP-38 encrypted keys is for paper wallets
      that can be<br>
      used to back up private keys on a piece of paper. As long as the user
      selects a strong<br>
      passphrase, a paper wallet with BIP-38 encrypted private keys is
      incredibly secure and<br>
      a great way to create offline bitcoin storage (also known as “cold
      storage”).<br>
      Test the encrypted keys in Table 4-5 using bitaddress.org to see how you
      can get the<br>
      decrypted key by entering the passphrase.<br>

      Pay-to-Script Hash (P2SH) and Multisig Addresses<br>
      As we know, traditional bitcoin addresses begin with the number “1” and
      are derived<br>
      from the public key, which is derived from the private key. Although
      anyone can send<br>
      bitcoin to a “1” address, that bitcoin can only be spent by presenting the
      correspond‐<br>
      ing private key signature and public key hash.<br>
      Bitcoin addresses that begin with the number “3” are pay-to-script hash
      (P2SH)<br>
      addresses, sometimes erroneously called multisignature or multisig
      addresses. They<br>
      designate the beneficiary of a bitcoin transaction as the hash of a
      script, instead of the<br>
      owner of a public key. The feature was introduced in January 2012 with
      BIP-16 (see<br>
      Appendix C), and is being widely adopted because it provides the
      opportunity to add<br>
      functionality to the address itself. Unlike transactions that “send” funds
      to traditional<br>
      “1” bitcoin addresses, also known as a pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH),
      funds sent<br>
      to “3” addresses require something more than the presentation of one
      public key hash<br>
      and one private key signature as proof of ownership. The requirements are
      designated<br>
      at the time the address is created, within the script, and all inputs to
      this address will<br>
      be encumbered with the same requirements.<br>
      A P2SH address is created from a transaction script, which defines who can
      spend a<br>
      transaction output (for more details, see “Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH)” on
      page 151).<br>
      Advanced Keys and Addresses<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;81<br>
      Encoding a P2SH address involves using the same double-hash function as
      used dur‐<br>
      ing creation of a bitcoin address, only applied on the script instead of
      the public key:<br>
      script hash = RIPEMD160(SHA256(script))<br>
      The resulting “script hash” is encoded with Base58Check with a version
      prefix of 5,<br>
      which results in an encoded address starting with a 3. An example of a
      P2SH address<br>
      is 3F6i6kwkevjR7AsAd4te2YB2zZyASEm1HM, which can be derived using the
      Bitcoin<br>
      Explorer commands script-encode, sha256, ripemd160, and base58check-encode<br>
      (see Appendix G) as follows:<br>
      $ echo dup hash160 [ 89abcdefabbaabbaabbaabbaabbaabbaabbaabba ]
      equalverify<br>
      checksig &gt; script<br>
      $ bx script-encode &lt; script | bx sha256 | bx ripemd160 | bx
      base58check-encode<br>
      --version 5<br>
      3F6i6kwkevjR7AsAd4te2YB2zZyASEm1HM<br>
      P2SH is not necessarily the same as a multisignature standard<br>
      transaction. A P2SH address most often represents a multi-<br>
      signature script, but it might also represent a script encoding other<br>
      types of transactions.<br>
      Multisignature addresses and P2SH<br>
      Currently, the most common implementation of the P2SH function is the
      multi-<br>
      signature address script. As the name implies, the underlying script
      requires more<br>
      than one signature to prove ownership and therefore spend funds. The
      bitcoin multi-<br>
      signature feature is designed to require M signatures (also known as the
      “threshold”)<br>
      from a total of N keys, known as an M-of-N multisig, where M is equal to
      or less than<br>
      N. For example, Bob the coffee shop owner from Chapter 1 could use a
      multisigna‐<br>
      ture address requiring 1-of-2 signatures from a key belonging to him and a
      key<br>
      belonging to his spouse, ensuring either of them could sign to spend a
      transaction<br>
      output locked to this address. This would be similar to a “joint account”
      as imple‐<br>
      mented in traditional banking where either spouse can spend with a single
      signature.<br>
      Or Gopesh, the web designer paid by Bob to create a website, might have a
      2-of-3<br>
      multisignature address for his business that ensures that no funds can be
      spent unless<br>
      at least two of the business partners sign a transaction.<br>
      We will explore how to create transactions that spend funds from P2SH (and
      multi-<br>
      signature) addresses in Chapter 6.<br>
      Vanity Addresses<br>
      Vanity addresses are valid bitcoin addresses that contain human-readable
      messages.<br>
      For example, 1LoveBPzzD72PUXLzCkYAtGFYmK5vYNR33 is a valid address that
      contains<br>
      the letters forming the word “Love” as the first four Base-58 letters.
      Vanity addresses<br>
      82<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 4: Keys, Addresses<br>
      require generating and testing billions of candidate private keys, until a
      bitcoin<br>
      address with the desired pattern is found. Although there are some
      optimizations in<br>
      the vanity generation algorithm, the process essentially involves picking
      a private key<br>
      at random, deriving the public key, deriving the bitcoin address, and
      checking to see<br>
      if it matches the desired vanity pattern, repeating billions of times
      until a match is<br>
      found.<br>
      Once a vanity address matching the desired pattern is found, the private
      key from<br>
      which it was derived can be used by the owner to spend bitcoin in exactly
      the same<br>
      way as any other address. Vanity addresses are no less or more secure than
      any other<br>
      address. They depend on the same Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and SHA
      as<br>
      any other address. You can no more easily find the private key of an
      address starting<br>
      with a vanity pattern than you can any other address.<br>
      In Chapter 1, we introduced Eugenia, a children’s charity director
      operating in the<br>
      Philippines. Let’s say that Eugenia is organizing a bitcoin fundraising
      drive and wants<br>
      to use a vanity bitcoin address to publicize the fundraising. Eugenia will
      create a van‐<br>
      ity address that starts with “1Kids” to promote the children’s charity
      fundraiser. Let’s<br>
      see how this vanity address will be created and what it means for the
      security of Euge‐<br>
      nia’s charity.<br>
      Generating vanity addresses<br>
      It’s important to realize that a bitcoin address is simply a number
      represented by sym‐<br>
      bols in the Base58 alphabet. The search for a pattern like “1Kids” can be
      seen as<br>
      searching for an address in the range from
      1Kids11111111111111111111111111111<br>
      to 1Kidszzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. There are approximately 5829
      (approxi‐<br>
      mately 1.4 * 1051) addresses in that range, all starting with “1Kids.”
      Table 4-6 shows<br>
      the range of addresses that have the prefix 1Kids.<br>
      Table 4-6. The range of vanity addresses starting with “1Kids”<br>

      Let’s look at the pattern “1Kids” as a number and see how frequently we

      this pattern in a bitcoin address (see Table 4-7). An average desktop
      computer PC,<br>
      without any specialized hardware, can search approximately 100,000 keys

      As you can see, Eugenia won’t be creating the vanity address
      “1KidsCharity” anytime<br>
      soon, even if she had access to several thousand computers. Each
      additional character<br>
      increases the difficulty by a factor of 58. Patterns with more than seven
      characters are<br>
      usually found by specialized hardware, such as custom-built desktops with
      multiple<br>
      GPUs. These are often repurposed bitcoin mining “rigs” that are no longer
      profitable<br>
      for bitcoin mining but can be used to find vanity addresses. Vanity
      searches on GPU<br>
      systems are many orders of magnitude faster than on a general-purpose CPU.<br>
      Another way to find a vanity address is to outsource the work to a pool of
      vanity min‐<br>
      ers, such as the pool at Vanity Pool. A pool is a service that allows
      those with GPU<br>
      hardware to earn bitcoin searching for vanity addresses for others. For a
      small pay‐<br>
      ment (0.01 bitcoin or approximately $5 at the time of this writing),
      Eugenia can out‐<br>
      source the search for a seven-character pattern vanity address and get
      results in a few<br>
      hours instead of having to run a CPU search for months.<br>
      Generating a vanity address is a brute-force exercise: try a random key,
      check the<br>
      resulting address to see if it matches the desired pattern, repeat until
      successful.<br>
      Example 4-9 shows an example of a “vanity miner,” a program designed to
      find vanity<br>
      addresses, written in C++. The example uses the libbitcoin library, which
      we intro‐<br>
      duced in “Alternative Clients, Libraries, and Toolkits” on page 51.<br>

      Example 4-10 uses std::random_device. Depending on the imple‐<br>
      mentation it may reflect a CSRNG provided by the underlying<br>
      operating system. In the case of a Unix-like operating system such<br>
      as Linux, it draws from /dev/urandom. The random number gener‐<br>
      ator used here is for demonstration purposes, and it is not appro‐<br>
      priate for generating production-quality bitcoin keys as it is not<br>
      implemented with sufficient security.<br>
      The example code must be compiled using a C++ compiler and linked against
      the lib‐<br>
      bitcoin library (which must be first installed on that system). To run the
      example, run<br>
      the vanity-miner executable with no parameters (see Example 4-10) and it
      will<br>
      attempt to find a vanity address starting with “1kid.”<br>

      The example code will take a few seconds to find a match for the
      three-character pat‐<br>
      tern “kid,” as we can see when we use the time Unix command to measure the
      execu‐<br>
      tion time. Change the search pattern in the source code and see how much
      longer it<br>
      takes for four- or five-character patterns!<br>
      Vanity address security<br>
      Vanity addresses can be used to enhance and to defeat security measures;
      they are<br>
      truly a double-edged sword. Used to improve security, a distinctive
      address makes it<br>
      harder for adversaries to substitute their own address and fool your
      customers into<br>
      paying them instead of you. Unfortunately, vanity addresses also make it
      possible for<br>
      anyone to create an address that resembles any random address, or even
      another van‐<br>
      ity address, thereby fooling your customers.<br>
      Eugenia could advertise a randomly generated address (e.g., 1J7mdg5rbQyUHE<br>
      NYdx39WVWK7fsLpEoXZy) to which people can send their donations. Or, she
      could<br>
      generate a vanity address that starts with 1Kids, to make it more
      distinctive.<br>
      In both cases, one of the risks of using a single fixed address (rather
      than a separate<br>
      dynamic address per donor) is that a thief might be able to infiltrate
      your website and<br>
      replace it with his own address, thereby diverting donations to himself.
      If you have<br>
      advertised your donation address in a number of different places, your
      users may vis‐<br>
      ually inspect the address before making a payment to ensure it is the same
      one they<br>
      saw on your website, on your email, and on your flyer. In the case of a
      random<br>
      address like 1J7mdg5rbQyUHENYdx39WVWK7fsLpEoXZy, the average user will
      perhaps<br>
      inspect the first few characters “1J7mdg” and be satisfied that the
      address matches.<br>
      Using a vanity address generator, someone with the intent to steal by
      substituting a<br>
      similar-looking address can quickly generate addresses that match the
      first few char‐<br>
      acters, as shown in Table 4-8.<br>
      Table 4-8. Generating vanity addresses to match a random address<br>
      Original Random Address<br>
      &nbsp;1J7mdg5rbQyUHENYdx39WVWK7fsLpEoXZy<br>

      Vanity (5-character match) 1J7mdgYqyNd4ya3UEcq31Q7sqRMXw2XZ6n<br>
      Vanity (6-character match) 1J7mdg5WxGENmwyJP9xuGhG5KRzu99BBCX<br>
      So does a vanity address increase security? If Eugenia generates the
      vanity address<br>
      1Kids33q44erFfpeXrmDSz7zEqG2FesZEN, users are likely to look at the vanity
      pattern<br>
      word and a few characters beyond, for example noticing the “1Kids33” part
      of the<br>
      address. That would force an attacker to generate a vanity address
      matching at least<br>
      six characters (two more), expending an effort that is 3,364 times (58 ×
      58) higher<br>
      than the effort Eugenia expended for her 4-character vanity. Essentially,
      the effort<br>
      Eugenia expends (or pays a vanity pool for) “pushes” the attacker into
      having to pro‐<br>
      Advanced Keys and Addresses<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;87<br>
      duce a longer pattern vanity. If Eugenia pays a pool to generate an
      8-character vanity<br>
      address, the attacker would be pushed into the realm of 10 characters,
      which is infea‐<br>
      sible on a personal computer and expensive even with a custom
      vanity-mining rig or<br>
      vanity pool. What is affordable for Eugenia becomes unaffordable for the
      attacker,<br>
      especially if the potential reward of fraud is not high enough to cover
      the cost of the<br>
      vanity address generation.<br>
      Paper Wallets<br>
      Paper wallets are bitcoin private keys printed on paper. Often the paper
      wallet also<br>
      includes the corresponding bitcoin address for convenience, but this is
      not necessary<br>
      because it can be derived from the private key. Paper wallets are a very
      effective way<br>
      to create backups or offline bitcoin storage, also known as “cold
      storage.” As a backup<br>
      mechanism, a paper wallet can provide security against the loss of key due
      to a com‐<br>
      puter mishap such as a hard-drive failure, theft, or accidental deletion.
      As a “cold<br>
      storage” mechanism, if the paper wallet keys are generated offline and
      never stored<br>
      on a computer system, they are much more secure against hackers,
      keyloggers, and<br>
      other online computer threats.<br>
      Paper wallets come in many shapes, sizes, and designs, but at a very basic
      level are<br>
      just a key and an address printed on paper. Table 4-9 shows the simplest
      form of a<br>
      paper wallet.<br>

      Paper wallets can be generated easily using a tool such as the client-side
      JavaScript<br>
      generator at bitaddress.org. This page contains all the code necessary to
      generate keys<br>
      and paper wallets, even while completely disconnected from the internet.
      To use it,<br>
      save the HTML page on your local drive or on an external USB flash drive.
      Discon‐<br>
      nect from the internet and open the file in a browser. Even better, boot
      your com‐<br>
      puter using a pristine operating system, such as a CD-ROM bootable Linux
      OS. Any<br>
      keys generated with this tool while offline can be printed on a local
      printer over a<br>
      USB cable (not wirelessly), thereby creating paper wallets whose keys
      exist only on<br>
      the paper and have never been stored on any online system. Put these paper
      wallets in<br>
      a fireproof safe and “send” bitcoin to their bitcoin address, to implement
      a simple yet<br>
      highly effective “cold storage” solution. Figure 4-8 shows a paper wallet
      generated<br>
      from the bitaddress.org site.<br>

      &nbsp;Chapter 4: Keys, Addresses<br>
      Figure 4-8. An example of a simple paper wallet from bitaddress.org<br>
      The disadvantage of a simple paper wallet system is that the printed keys
      are vulnera‐<br>
      ble to theft. A thief who is able to gain access to the paper can either
      steal it or photo‐<br>
      graph the keys and take control of the bitcoin locked with those keys. A
      more<br>
      sophisticated paper wallet storage system uses BIP-38 encrypted private
      keys. The<br>
      keys printed on the paper wallet are protected by a passphrase that the
      owner has<br>
      memorized. Without the passphrase, the encrypted keys are useless. Yet,
      they still are<br>
      superior to a passphrase-protected wallet because the keys have never been
      online<br>
      and must be physically retrieved from a safe or other physically secured
      storage.<br>

      created on the<br>
      bitaddress.org site.<br>

      Although you can deposit funds into a paper wallet several times,<br>
      you should withdraw all funds only once, spending everything.<br>
      This is because in the process of unlocking and spending funds<br>
      some wallets might generate a change address if you spend less<br>
      than the whole amount. Additionally, if the computer you use to<br>
      sign the transaction is compromised, you risk exposing the private<br>
      key. By spending the entire balance of a paper wallet only once, you<br>
      reduce the risk of key compromise. If you need only a small<br>
      amount, send any remaining funds to a new paper wallet in the<br>
      same transaction.<br>
      Paper wallets come in many designs and sizes, with many different
      features. Some are<br>
      intended to be given as gifts and have seasonal themes, such as Christmas
      and New<br>
      Year’s themes. Others are designed for storage in a bank vault or safe
      with the private<br>
      key hidden in some way, either with opaque scratch-off stickers, or folded
      and sealed<br>
      with tamper-proof adhesive foil. Figures 4-10 through 4-12 show various
      examples of<br>
      paper wallets with security and backup features.<br>

      Other designs feature additional copies of the key and address, in the

      able stubs similar to ticket stubs, allowing you to store multiple copies
      to protect<br>
      against fire, flood, or other natural disasters.<br>

      CHAPTER 5<br>
      Wallets<br>
      The word “wallet” is used to describe a few different things in bitcoin.<br>
      At a high level, a wallet is an application that serves as the primary
      user interface. The<br>
      wallet controls access to a user’s money, managing keys and addresses,
      tracking the<br>
      balance, and creating and signing transactions.<br>
      More narrowly, from a programmer’s perspective, the word “wallet” refers
      to the data<br>
      structure used to store and manage a user’s keys.<br>
      In this chapter we will look at the second meaning, where wallets are
      containers for<br>
      private keys, usually implemented as structured files or simple databases.<br>
      Wallet Technology Overview<br>
      In this section we summarize the various technologies used to construct
      user-<br>
      friendly, secure, and flexible bitcoin wallets.<br>
      A common misconception about bitcoin is that bitcoin wallets contain
      bitcoin. In<br>
      fact, the wallet contains only keys. The “coins” are recorded in the
      blockchain on the<br>
      bitcoin network. Users control the coins on the network by signing
      transactions with<br>
      the keys in their wallets. In a sense, a bitcoin wallet is a keychain.<br>
      Bitcoin wallets contain keys, not coins. Each user has a wallet con‐<br>
      taining keys. Wallets are really keychains containing pairs of pri‐<br>
      vate/public keys (see “Private and Public Keys” on page 57). Users<br>
      sign transactions with the keys, thereby proving they own the<br>
      transaction outputs (their coins). The coins are stored on the<br>
      blockchain in the form of transaction outputs (often noted as vout<br>
      or txout).<br>
      93<br>
      There are two primary types of wallets, distinguished by whether the keys
      they con‐<br>
      tain are related to each other or not.<br>
      The first type is a nondeterministic wallet, where each key is
      independently generated<br>
      from a random number. The keys are not related to each other. This type of
      wallet is<br>
      also known as a JBOK wallet from the phrase “Just a Bunch Of Keys.”<br>
      The second type of wallet is a deterministic wallet, where all the keys
      are derived from<br>
      a single master key, known as the seed. All the keys in this type of
      wallet are related to<br>
      each other and can be generated again if one has the original seed. There
      are a num‐<br>
      ber of different key derivation methods used in deterministic wallets. The
      most com‐<br>
      monly used derivation method uses a tree-like structure and is known as a<br>
      hierarchical deterministic or HD wallet.<br>
      Deterministic wallets are initialized from a seed. To make these easier to
      use, seeds<br>
      are encoded as English words, also known as mnemonic code words.<br>
      The next few sections introduce each of these technologies at a high
      level.<br>
      Nondeterministic (Random) Wallets<br>
      In the first bitcoin wallet (now called Bitcoin Core), wallets were
      collections of ran‐<br>
      domly generated private keys. For example, the original Bitcoin Core
      client pregener‐<br>
      ates 100 random private keys when first started and generates more keys as
      needed,<br>
      using each key only once. Such wallets are being replaced with
      deterministic wallets<br>
      because they are cumbersome to manage, back up, and import. The
      disadvantage of<br>
      random keys is that if you generate many of them you must keep copies of
      all of<br>
      them, meaning that the wallet must be backed up frequently. Each key must
      be<br>
      backed up, or the funds it controls are irrevocably lost if the wallet
      becomes inaccessi‐<br>
      ble. This conflicts directly with the principle of avoiding address reuse,
      by using each<br>
      bitcoin address for only one transaction. Address reuse reduces privacy by
      associating<br>
      multiple transactions and addresses with each other. A Type-0
      nondeterministic wal‐<br>
      let is a poor choice of wallet, especially if you want to avoid address
      reuse because it<br>
      means managing many keys, which creates the need for frequent backups.
      Although<br>
      the Bitcoin Core client includes a Type-0 wallet, using this wallet is
      discouraged by<br>
      developers of Bitcoin Core. Figure 5-1 shows a nondeterministic wallet,
      containing a<br>
      loose collection of random keys.<br>
      The use of nondeterministic wallets is discouraged for anything<br>
      other than simple tests. They are simply too cumbersome to back<br>
      up and use. Instead, use an industry-standard–based HD wallet<br>
      with a mnemonic seed for backup.<br>

      Deterministic (Seeded) Wallets<br>
      Deterministic, or “seeded,” wallets are wallets that contain private keys
      that are all<br>
      derived from a common seed, through the use of a one-way hash function.
      The seed<br>
      is a randomly generated number that is combined with other data, such as
      an index<br>
      number or “chain code” (see “HD Wallets (BIP-32/BIP-44)” on page 96) to
      derive the<br>
      private keys. In a deterministic wallet, the seed is sufficient to recover
      all the derived<br>
      keys, and therefore a single backup at creation time is sufficient. The
      seed is also suffi‐<br>
      cient for a wallet export or import, allowing for easy migration of all
      the user’s keys<br>
      between different wallet implementations. Figure 5-2 shows a logical
      diagram of a<br>
      deterministic wallet.<br>

      Seeds and Mnemonic Codes (BIP-39)<br>
      HD wallets are a very powerful mechanism for managing many keys and
      addresses.<br>
      They are even more useful if they are combined with a standardized way of
      creating<br>
      seeds from a sequence of English words that are easy to transcribe,
      export, and<br>
      import across wallets. This is known as a mnemonic and the standard is
      defined by<br>
      BIP-39. Today, most bitcoin wallets (as well as wallets for other
      cryptocurrencies) use<br>
      this standard and can import and export seeds for backup and recovery
      using intero‐<br>
      perable mnemonics.<br>
      Let’s look at this from a practical perspective. Which of the following
      seeds is easier to<br>
      transcribe, record on paper, read without error, export, and import into
      another wal‐<br>

      Wallet Best Practices<br>
      As bitcoin wallet technology has matured, certain common industry
      standards have<br>
      emerged that make bitcoin wallets broadly interoperable, easy to use,
      secure, and flex‐<br>
      ible. These common standards are:<br>
      • Mnemonic code words, based on BIP-39<br>
      • HD wallets, based on BIP-32<br>
      • Multipurpose HD wallet structure, based on BIP-43<br>
      • Multicurrency and multiaccount wallets, based on BIP-44<br>
      These standards may change or may become obsolete by future developments,
      but for<br>
      now they form a set of interlocking technologies that have become the de
      facto wallet<br>
      standard for bitcoin.<br>
      The standards have been adopted by a broad range of software and hardware
      bitcoin<br>
      wallets, making all these wallets interoperable. A user can export a
      mnemonic gener‐<br>
      ated on one of these wallets and import it in another wallet, recovering
      all transac‐<br>
      tions, keys, and addresses.<br>
      Some example of software wallets supporting these standards include
      (listed alpha‐<br>
      betically) Breadwallet, Copay, Multibit HD, and Mycelium. Examples of
      hardware<br>
      wallets supporting these standards include (listed alphabetically)
      Keepkey, Ledger,<br>
      and Trezor.<br>
      The following sections examine each of these technologies in detail.<br>
      Wallet Technology Overview<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;97<br>
      If you are implementing a bitcoin wallet, it should be built as a HD<br>
      wallet, with a seed encoded as mnemonic code for backup, follow‐<br>
      ing the BIP-32, BIP-39, BIP-43, and BIP-44 standards, as described<br>
      in the following sections.<br>
      Using a Bitcoin Wallet<br>
      In “Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories” on page 5 we introduced
      Gabriel, an enter‐<br>
      prising young teenager in Rio de Janeiro, who is running a simple web
      store that sells<br>
      bitcoin-branded t-shirts, coffee mugs, and stickers.<br>
      Gabriel uses a Trezor bitcoin hardware wallet (Figure 5-4) to securely
      manage his bit‐<br>
      coin. The Trezor is a simple USB device with two buttons that stores keys
      (in the<br>
      form of an HD wallet) and signs transactions. Trezor wallets implement all
      the indus‐<br>
      try standards discussed in this chapter, so Gabriel is not reliant on any
      proprietary<br>
      technology or single vendor solution.<br>
      Figure 5-4. A Trezor device: a bitcoin HD wallet in hardware<br>
      When Gabriel used the Trezor for the first time, the device generated a
      mnemonic<br>
      and seed from a built-in hardware random number generator. During this
      initializa‐<br>
      tion phase, the wallet displayed a numbered sequence of words, one by one,
      on the<br>
      screen (see Figure 5-5).<br>
      Figure 5-5. Trezor displaying one of the mnemonic words<br>
      By writing down this mnemonic, Gabriel created a backup (see Table 5-1)
      that can be<br>
      used for recovery in the case of loss or damage to the Trezor device. This
      mnemonic<br>
      can be used for recovery in a new Trezor or in any one of the many
      compatible soft‐<br>
      ware or hardware wallets. Note that the sequence of words is important, so<br>
      98<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 5: Wallets<br>
      mnemonic paper backups have numbered spaces for each word. Gabriel had to
      care‐<br>
      fully record each word in the numbered space to preserve the correct
      sequence.<br>

      A 12-word mnemonic is shown in Table 5-1, for simplicity. In fact,<br>
      most hardware wallets generate a more secure 24-word mnemonic.<br>
      The mnemonic is used in exactly the same way, regardless of<br>
      length.<br>
      For the first implementation of his web store, Gabriel uses a single
      bitcoin address,<br>
      generated on his Trezor device. This single address is used by all
      customers for all<br>
      orders. As we will see, this approach has some drawbacks and can be
      improved upon<br>
      with an HD wallet.<br>
      Wallet Technology Details<br>
      Let’s now examine each of the important industry standards that are used
      by many<br>
      bitcoin wallets in detail.<br>
      Mnemonic Code Words (BIP-39)<br>
      Mnemonic code words are word sequences that represent (encode) a random
      num‐<br>
      ber used as a seed to derive a deterministic wallet. The sequence of words
      is sufficient<br>
      to re-create the seed and from there re-create the wallet and all the
      derived keys. A<br>
      wallet application that implements deterministic wallets with mnemonic
      words will<br>
      show the user a sequence of 12 to 24 words when first creating a wallet.
      That<br>
      sequence of words is the wallet backup and can be used to recover and
      re-create all<br>
      the keys in the same or any compatible wallet application. Mnemonic words
      make it<br>
      easier for users to back up wallets because they are easy to read and
      correctly tran‐<br>
      scribe, as compared to a random sequence of numbers.<br>
      Wallet Technology Details<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;99<br>
      Mnemonic words are often confused with “brainwallets.” They are<br>
      not the same. The primary difference is that a brainwallet consists<br>
      of words chosen by the user, whereas mnemonic words are created<br>
      randomly by the wallet and presented to the user. This important<br>
      difference makes mnemonic words much more secure, because<br>
      humans are very poor sources of randomness.<br>
      Mnemonic codes are defined in BIP-39 (see Appendix C). Note that BIP-39 is
      one<br>
      implementation of a mnemonic code standard. There is a different standard,
      with a<br>
      different set of words, used by the Electrum wallet and predating BIP-39.
      BIP-39 was<br>
      proposed by the company behind the Trezor hardware wallet and is
      incompatible<br>
      with Electrum’s implementation. However, BIP-39 has now achieved broad
      industry<br>
      support across dozens of interoperable implementations and should be
      considered<br>
      the de facto industry standard.<br>
      BIP-39 defines the creation of a mnemonic code and seed, which we describe
      here in<br>
      nine steps. For clarity, the process is split into two parts: steps 1
      through 6 are shown<br>
      in “Generating mnemonic words” on page 100 and steps 7 through 9 are shown
      in<br>
      “From mnemonic to seed” on page 101.<br>
      Generating mnemonic words<br>
      Mnemonic words are generated automatically by the wallet using the
      standardized<br>
      process defined in BIP-39. The wallet starts from a source of entropy,
      adds a check‐<br>
      sum, and then maps the entropy to a word list:<br>
      1. Create a random sequence (entropy) of 128 to 256 bits.<br>
      2. Create a checksum of the random sequence by taking the first (entropy-<br>
      length/32) bits of its SHA256 hash.<br>
      3. Add the checksum to the end of the random sequence.<br>
      4. Divide the sequence into sections of 11 bits.<br>
      5. Map each 11-bit value to a word from the predefined dictionary of 2048
      words.<br>
      6. The mnemonic code is the sequence of words.<br>

      From mnemonic to seed<br>
      The mnemonic words represent entropy with a length of 128 to 256 bits. The
      entropy<br>
      is then used to derive a longer (512-bit) seed through the use of the
      key-stretching<br>
      function PBKDF2. The seed produced is then used to build a deterministic
      wallet and<br>
      derive its keys.<br>
      Wallet Technology Details<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;101<br>
      The key-stretching function takes two parameters: the mnemonic and a salt.
      The pur‐<br>
      pose of a salt in a key-stretching function is to make it difficult to
      build a lookup table<br>
      enabling a brute-force attack. In the BIP-39 standard, the salt has
      another purpose—it<br>
      allows the introduction of a passphrase that serves as an additional
      security factor<br>
      protecting the seed, as we will describe in more detail in “Optional
      passphrase in<br>
      BIP-39” on page 104.<br>
      The process described in steps 7 through 9 continues from the process
      described pre‐<br>
      viously in “Generating mnemonic words” on page 100:<br>
      7. The first parameter to the PBKDF2 key-stretching function is the
      mnemonic pro‐<br>
      duced from step 6.<br>
      8. The second parameter to the PBKDF2 key-stretching function is a salt.
      The salt is<br>
      composed of the string constant "mnemonic" concatenated with an optional
      user-<br>
      supplied passphrase string.<br>
      9. PBKDF2 stretches the mnemonic and salt parameters using 2048 rounds of
      hash‐<br>
      ing with the HMAC-SHA512 algorithm, producing a 512-bit value as its final<br>
      output. That 512-bit value is the seed.<br>
      Figure 5-7 shows how a mnemonic is used to generate a seed.<br>

      &nbsp;Chapter 5: Wallets<br>
      The key-stretching function, with its 2048 rounds of hashing, is a<br>
      very effective protection against brute-force attacks against the<br>
      mnemonic or the passphrase. It makes it extremely costly (in com‐<br>
      putation) to try more than a few thousand passphrase and<br>
      mnemonic combinations, while the number of possible derived<br>
      seeds is vast (2512).<br>

      Optional passphrase in BIP-39<br>
      The BIP-39 standard allows the use of an optional passphrase in the
      derivation of the<br>
      seed. If no passphrase is used, the mnemonic is stretched with a salt
      consisting of the<br>
      constant string "mnemonic", producing a specific 512-bit seed from any
      given<br>
      mnemonic. If a passphrase is used, the stretching function produces a
      different seed<br>
      from that same mnemonic. In fact, given a single mnemonic, every possible
      pass‐<br>
      phrase leads to a different seed. Essentially, there is no “wrong”
      passphrase. All pass‐<br>
      phrases are valid and they all lead to different seeds, forming a vast set
      of possible<br>
      uninitialized wallets. The set of possible wallets is so large (2512) that
      there is no prac‐<br>
      tical possibility of brute-forcing or accidentally guessing one that is in
      use.<br>
      There are no “wrong” passphrases in BIP-39. Every passphrase<br>
      leads to some wallet, which unless previously used will be empty.<br>
      The optional passphrase creates two important features:<br>
      • A second factor (something memorized) that makes a mnemonic useless on
      its<br>
      own, protecting mnemonic backups from compromise by a thief.<br>
      • A form of plausible deniability or “duress wallet,” where a chosen
      passphrase<br>
      leads to a wallet with a small amount of funds used to distract an
      attacker from<br>
      the “real” wallet that contains the majority of funds.<br>
      However, it is important to note that the use of a passphrase also
      introduces the risk<br>
      of loss:<br>
      • If the wallet owner is incapacitated or dead and no one else knows the
      pass‐<br>
      phrase, the seed is useless and all the funds stored in the wallet are
      lost forever.<br>
      • Conversely, if the owner backs up the passphrase in the same place as
      the seed, it<br>
      defeats the purpose of a second factor.<br>
      While passphrases are very useful, they should only be used in combination
      with a<br>
      carefully planned process for backup and recovery, considering the
      possibility of sur‐<br>
      viving the owner and allowing his or her family to recover the
      cryptocurrency estate.<br>

      Creating an HD Wallet from the Seed<br>
      HD wallets are created from a single root seed, which is a 128-, 256-, or
      512-bit ran‐<br>
      dom number. Most commonly, this seed is generated from a mnemonic as
      detailed in<br>
      the previous section.<br>
      Every key in the HD wallet is deterministically derived from this root
      seed, which<br>
      makes it possible to re-create the entire HD wallet from that seed in any
      compatible<br>
      HD wallet. This makes it easy to back up, restore, export, and import HD
      wallets con‐<br>
      taining thousands or even millions of keys by simply transferring only the
      mnemonic<br>
      that the root seed is derived from.<br>
      The process of creating the master keys and master chain code for an HD
      wallet is<br>
      shown in Figure 5-9.<br>
      Figure 5-9. Creating master keys and chain code from a root seed<br>
      The root seed is input into the HMAC-SHA512 algorithm and the resulting
      hash is<br>
      used to create a master private key (m) and a master chain code (c).<br>
      The master private key (m) then generates a corresponding master public
      key (M)<br>
      using the normal elliptic curve multiplication process m * G that we saw
      in “Public<br>
      Keys” on page 60.<br>
      The chain code (c) is used to introduce entropy in the function that
      creates child keys<br>
      from parent keys, as we will see in the next section.<br>
      Private child key derivation<br>
      HD wallets use a child key derivation (CKD) function to derive child keys
      from parent<br>
      keys.<br>
      106<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 5: Wallets<br>
      The child key derivation functions are based on a one-way hash function
      that com‐<br>
      bines:<br>
      • A parent private or public key (ECDSA uncompressed key)<br>
      • A seed called a chain code (256 bits)<br>
      • An index number (32 bits)<br>
      The chain code is used to introduce deterministic random data to the
      process, so that<br>
      knowing the index and a child key is not sufficient to derive other child
      keys. Know‐<br>
      ing a child key does not make it possible to find its siblings, unless you
      also have the<br>
      chain code. The initial chain code seed (at the root of the tree) is made
      from the seed,<br>
      while subsequent child chain codes are derived from each parent chain
      code.<br>
      These three items (parent key, chain code, and index) are combined and
      hashed to<br>
      generate children keys, as follows.<br>
      The parent public key, chain code, and the index number are combined and
      hashed<br>
      with the HMAC-SHA512 algorithm to produce a 512-bit hash. This 512-bit
      hash is<br>
      split into two 256-bit halves. The right-half 256 bits of the hash output
      become the<br>
      chain code for the child. The left-half 256 bits of the hash are added to
      the parent<br>
      private key to produce the child private key. In Figure 5-10, we see this
      illustrated<br>
      with the index set to 0 to produce the “zero” (first by index) child of
      the parent.<br>
      Figure 5-10. Extending a parent private key to create a child private key<br>
      Changing the index allows us to extend the parent and create the other
      children in<br>
      the sequence, e.g., Child 0, Child 1, Child 2, etc. Each parent key can
      have<br>
      Wallet Technology Details<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;107<br>
      2,147,483,647 (231) children (231 is half of the entire 232 range
      available because the<br>
      other half is reserved for a special type of derivation we will talk about
      later in this<br>
      chapter).<br>
      Repeating the process one level down the tree, each child can in turn
      become a parent<br>
      and create its own children, in an infinite number of generations.<br>
      Using derived child keys<br>
      Child private keys are indistinguishable from nondeterministic (random)
      keys.<br>
      Because the derivation function is a one-way function, the child key
      cannot be used<br>
      to find the parent key. The child key also cannot be used to find any
      siblings. If you<br>
      have the nth child, you cannot find its siblings, such as the n–1 child or
      the n+1 child,<br>
      or any other children that are part of the sequence. Only the parent key
      and chain<br>
      code can derive all the children. Without the child chain code, the child
      key cannot<br>
      be used to derive any grandchildren either. You need both the child
      private key and<br>
      the child chain code to start a new branch and derive grandchildren.<br>
      So what can the child private key be used for on its own? It can be used
      to make a<br>
      public key and a bitcoin address. Then, it can be used to sign
      transactions to spend<br>
      anything paid to that address.<br>
      A child private key, the corresponding public key, and the bitcoin<br>
      address are all indistinguishable from keys and addresses created<br>
      randomly. The fact that they are part of a sequence is not visible<br>
      outside of the HD wallet function that created them. Once created,<br>
      they operate exactly as “normal” keys.<br>
      Extended keys<br>
      As we saw earlier, the key derivation function can be used to create
      children at any<br>
      level of the tree, based on the three inputs: a key, a chain code, and the
      index of the<br>
      desired child. The two essential ingredients are the key and chain code,
      and com‐<br>
      bined these are called an extended key. The term “extended key” could also
      be thought<br>
      of as “extensible key” because such a key can be used to derive children.<br>
      Extended keys are stored and represented simply as the concatenation of
      the 256-bit<br>
      key and 256-bit chain code into a 512-bit sequence. There are two types of
      extended<br>
      keys. An extended private key is the combination of a private key and
      chain code and<br>
      can be used to derive child private keys (and from them, child public
      keys). An exten‐<br>
      ded public key is a public key and chain code, which can be used to create
      child pub‐<br>
      lic keys (public only), as described in “Generating a Public Key” on page
      63.<br>
      Think of an extended key as the root of a branch in the tree structure of
      the HD wal‐<br>
      let. With the root of the branch, you can derive the rest of the branch.
      The extended<br>
      108<br>
      &nbsp;| Chapter 5: Wallets<br>
      private key can create a complete branch, whereas the extended public key
      can only<br>
      create a branch of public keys.<br>
      An extended key consists of a private or public key and chain code.<br>
      An extended key can create children, generating its own branch in<br>
      the tree structure. Sharing an extended key gives access to the<br>
      entire branch.<br>
      Extended keys are encoded using Base58Check, to easily export and import
      between<br>
      different BIP-32–compatible wallets. The Base58Check coding for extended
      keys uses<br>
      a special version number that results in the prefix “xprv” and “xpub” when
      encoded<br>
      in Base58 characters to make them easily recognizable. Because the
      extended key is<br>
      512 or 513 bits, it is also much longer than other Base58Check-encoded
      strings we<br>
      have seen previously.<br>
      Here’s an example of an extended private key, encoded in Base58Check:<br>

      Public child key derivation<br>
      As mentioned previously, a very useful characteristic of HD wallets is the
      ability to<br>
      derive public child keys from public parent keys, without having the
      private keys.<br>
      This gives us two ways to derive a child public key: either from the child
      private key,<br>
      or directly from the parent public key.<br>
      An extended public key can be used, therefore, to derive all of the public
      keys (and<br>
      only the public keys) in that branch of the HD wallet structure.<br>
      This shortcut can be used to create very secure public key–only
      deployments where a<br>
      server or application has a copy of an extended public key and no private
      keys what‐<br>
      soever. That kind of deployment can produce an infinite number of public
      keys and<br>
      bitcoin addresses, but cannot spend any of the money sent to those
      addresses. Mean‐<br>
      while, on another, more secure server, the extended private key can derive
      all the cor‐<br>
      responding private keys to sign transactions and spend the money.<br>
      One common application of this solution is to install an extended public
      key on a<br>
      web server that serves an ecommerce application. The web server can use
      the public<br>
      key derivation function to create a new bitcoin address for every
      transaction (e.g., for<br>
      a customer shopping cart). The web server will not have any private keys
      that would<br>

      However, the little web store became quite successful and attracted many
      orders from<br>
      the local community. Soon, Gabriel was overwhelmed. With all the orders
      paying the<br>
      same address, it became difficult to correctly match orders and
      transactions, espe‐<br>
      cially when multiple orders for the same amount came in close together.<br>
      Gabriel’s HD wallet offers a much better solution through the ability to
      derive public<br>
      child keys without knowing the private keys. Gabriel can load an extended
      public key<br>
      (xpub) on his website, which can be used to derive a unique address for
      every cus‐<br>
      tomer order. Gabriel can spend the funds from his Trezor, but the xpub
      loaded on the<br>
      website can only generate addresses and receive funds. This feature of HD
      wallets is a<br>
      great security feature. Gabriel’s website does not contain any private
      keys and there‐<br>
      fore does not need high levels of security.<br>
      To export the xpub, Gabriel uses the web-based software in conjunction
      with the Tre‐<br>
      zor hardware wallet. The Trezor device must be plugged in for the public
      keys to be<br>
      exported. Note that hardware wallets will never export private keys—those
      always<br>
      remain on the device. Figure 5-12 shows the web interface Gabriel uses to
      export the<br>
      xpub.<br>
      Figure 5-12. Exporting an xpub from a Trezor hardware wallet<br>
      Gabriel copies the xpub to his web store’s bitcoin shop software. He uses
      Mycelium<br>
      Gear, which is an open source web-store plugin for a variety of web
      hosting and con‐<br>
      Wallet Technology Details<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;111<br>
      tent platforms. Mycelium Gear uses the xpub to generate a unique address
      for every<br>
      purchase.<br>
      Hardened child key derivation<br>
      The ability to derive a branch of public keys from an xpub is very useful,
      but it comes<br>
      with a potential risk. Access to an xpub does not give access to child
      private keys.<br>
      However, because the xpub contains the chain code, if a child private key
      is known, or<br>
      somehow leaked, it can be used with the chain code to derive all the other
      child pri‐<br>
      vate keys. A single leaked child private key, together with a parent chain
      code, reveals<br>
      all the private keys of all the children. Worse, the child private key
      together with a<br>
      parent chain code can be used to deduce the parent private key.<br>
      To counter this risk, HD wallets use an alternative derivation function
      called hard‐<br>
      ened derivation, which “breaks” the relationship between parent public key
      and child<br>
      chain code. The hardened derivation function uses the parent private key
      to derive<br>
      the child chain code, instead of the parent public key. This creates a
      “firewall” in the<br>
      parent/child sequence, with a chain code that cannot be used to compromise
      a parent<br>
      or sibling private key. The hardened derivation function looks almost
      identical to the<br>
      normal child private key derivation, except that the parent private key is
      used as input<br>
      to the hash function, instead of the parent public key, as shown in the
      diagram in<br>
      Figure 5-13.<br>

      Navigating the HD wallet tree structure<br>
      The HD wallet tree structure offers tremendous flexibility. Each parent
      extended key<br>
      can have 4 billion children: 2 billion normal children and 2 billion
      hardened children.<br>
      Each of those children can have another 4 billion children, and so on. The
      tree can be<br>
      as deep as you want, with an infinite number of generations. With all that
      flexibility,<br>
      however, it becomes quite difficult to navigate this infinite tree. It is
      especially diffi‐<br>
      cult to transfer HD wallets between implementations, because the
      possibilities for<br>
      internal organization into branches and subbranches are endless.<br>
      Two BIPs offer a solution to this complexity by creating some proposed
      standards for<br>
      the structure of HD wallet trees. BIP-43 proposes the use of the first
      hardened child<br>
      index as a special identifier that signifies the “purpose” of the tree
      structure. Based on<br>
      BIP-43, an HD wallet should use only one level-1 branch of the tree, with
      the index<br>
      number identifying the structure and namespace of the rest of the tree by
      defining its<br>
      purpose. For example, an HD wallet using only branch m/i'/ is intended to
      signify a<br>
      specific purpose and that purpose is identified by index number “i.”<br>
      Extending that specification, BIP-44 proposes a multiaccount structure as
      “purpose”<br>
      number 44' under BIP-43. All HD wallets following the BIP-44 structure are
      identi‐<br>
      fied by the fact that they only used one branch of the tree: m/44'/.<br>
      BIP-44 specifies the structure as consisting of five predefined tree
      levels:<br>
      m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index<br>
      The first-level “purpose” is always set to 44'. The second-level
      “coin_type” specifies<br>
      the type of cryptocurrency coin, allowing for multicurrency HD wallets
      where each<br>
      currency has its own subtree under the second level. There are three
      currencies<br>
      defined for now: Bitcoin is m/44'/0', Bitcoin Testnet is m/44'/1', and
      Litecoin is<br>
      m/44'/2'.<br>
      The third level of the tree is “account,” which allows users to subdivide
      their wallets<br>
      into separate logical subaccounts, for accounting or organizational
      purposes. For<br>
      example, an HD wallet might contain two bitcoin “accounts”: m/44'/0'/0'
      and<br>
      m/44'/0'/1'. Each account is the root of its own subtree.<br>
      114<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 5: Wallets<br>
      On the fourth level, “change,” an HD wallet has two subtrees, one for
      creating receiv‐<br>
      ing addresses and one for creating change addresses. Note that whereas the
      previous<br>
      levels used hardened derivation, this level uses normal derivation. This
      is to allow this<br>
      level of the tree to export extended public keys for use in a nonsecured
      environment.<br>
      Usable addresses are derived by the HD wallet as children of the fourth
      level, making<br>
      the fifth level of the tree the “address_index.” For example, the third
      receiving address<br>
      for bitcoin payments in the primary account would be M/44'/0'/0'/0/2.

      CHAPTER 6<br>
      Transactions<br>
      Introduction<br>
      Transactions are the most important part of the bitcoin system. Everything
      else in bit‐<br>
      coin is designed to ensure that transactions can be created, propagated on
      the net‐<br>
      work, validated, and finally added to the global ledger of transactions
      (the<br>
      blockchain). Transactions are data structures that encode the transfer of
      value<br>
      between participants in the bitcoin system. Each transaction is a public
      entry in bit‐<br>
      coin’s blockchain, the global double-entry bookkeeping ledger.<br>
      In this chapter we will examine all the various forms of transactions,
      what they con‐<br>
      tain, how to create them, how they are verified, and how they become part
      of the per‐<br>
      manent record of all transactions. When we use the term “wallet” in this
      chapter, we<br>
      are referring to the software that constructs transactions, not just the
      database of<br>
      keys.<br>
      Transactions in Detail<br>
      In Chapter 2, we looked at the transaction Alice used to pay for coffee at
      Bob’s coffee<br>
      shop using a block explorer (Figure 6-1).<br>
      The block explorer application shows a transaction from Alice’s “address”
      to Bob’s<br>
      “address.” This is a much simplified view of what is contained in a
      transaction. In fact,<br>
      as we will see in this chapter, much of the information shown is
      constructed by the<br>
      block explorer and is not actually in the transaction.<br>
      117<br>
      Figure 6-1. Alice’s transaction to Bob’s Cafe<br>
      Transactions—Behind the Scenes<br>
      Behind the scenes, an actual transaction looks very different from a
      transaction pro‐<br>
      vided by a typical block explorer. In fact, most of the high-level
      constructs we see in<br>
      the various bitcoin application user interfaces do not actually exist in
      the bitcoin sys‐<br>
      tem.<br>
      We can use Bitcoin Core’s command-line interface (getrawtransaction and
      decoder<br>
      awtransaction) to retrieve Alice’s “raw” transaction, decode it, and see
      what it con‐<br>
      tains. The result looks like this:<br>

      You may notice a few things about this transaction, mostly the things that
      are miss‐<br>
      ing! Where is Alice’s address? Where is Bob’s address? Where is the 0.1
      input “sent”<br>
      by Alice? In bitcoin, there are no coins, no senders, no recipients, no
      balances, no<br>
      accounts, and no addresses. All those things are constructed at a higher
      level for the<br>
      benefit of the user, to make things easier to understand.<br>
      You may also notice a lot of strange and indecipherable fields and
      hexadecimal<br>
      strings. Don’t worry, we will explain each field shown here in detail in
      this chapter.<br>
      Transaction Outputs and Inputs<br>
      The fundamental building block of a bitcoin transaction is a transaction
      output.<br>
      Transaction outputs are indivisible chunks of bitcoin currency, recorded
      on the<br>
      blockchain, and recognized as valid by the entire network. Bitcoin full
      nodes track all<br>
      available and spendable outputs, known as unspent transaction outputs, or
      UTXO.<br>
      The collection of all UTXO is known as the UTXO set and currently numbers
      in the<br>
      millions of UTXO. The UTXO set grows as new UTXO is created and shrinks
      when<br>
      UTXO is consumed. Every transaction represents a change (state transition)
      in the<br>
      UTXO set.<br>
      When we say that a user’s wallet has “received” bitcoin, what we mean is
      that the wal‐<br>
      let has detected a UTXO that can be spent with one of the keys controlled
      by that<br>
      wallet. Thus, a user’s bitcoin “balance” is the sum of all UTXO that
      user’s wallet can<br>
      spend and which may be scattered among hundreds of transactions and
      hundreds of<br>
      blocks. The concept of a balance is created by the wallet application. The
      wallet calcu‐<br>
      lates the user’s balance by scanning the blockchain and aggregating the
      value of any<br>
      UTXO the wallet can spend with the keys it controls. Most wallets maintain
      a data‐<br>
      base or use a database service to store a quick reference set of all the
      UTXO they can<br>
      spend with the keys they control.<br>
      A transaction output can have an arbitrary (integer) value denominated as
      a multiple<br>
      of satoshis. Just like dollars can be divided down to two decimal places
      as cents, bit‐<br>
      coin can be divided down to eight decimal places as satoshis. Although an
      output can<br>
      have any arbitrary value, once created it is indivisible. This is an
      important character‐<br>
      Transaction Outputs and Inputs<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;119<br>
      What comes first? Inputs or outputs, the chicken or the egg?<br>
      Strictly speaking, outputs come first because coinbase transactions,<br>
      which generate new bitcoin, have no inputs and create outputs<br>
      from nothing.<br>
      Transaction Outputs<br>
      Every bitcoin transaction creates outputs, which are recorded on the
      bitcoin ledger.<br>
      Almost all of these outputs, with one exception (see “Data Recording
      Output<br>
      (RETURN)” on page 155) create spendable chunks of bitcoin called UTXO,
      which are<br>
      then recognized by the whole network and available for the owner to spend
      in a<br>
      future transaction.<br>
      UTXO are tracked by every full-node bitcoin client in the UTXO set. New
      transac‐<br>
      tions consume (spend) one or more of these outputs from the UTXO set.<br>
      Transaction outputs consist of two parts:<br>
      • An amount of bitcoin, denominated in satoshis, the smallest bitcoin unit<br>
      • A cryptographic puzzle that determines the conditions required to spend
      the<br>
      output<br>
      The cryptographic puzzle is also known as a locking script, a witness
      script, or a<br>
      scriptPubKey.<br>
      The transaction scripting language, used in the locking script mentioned
      previously,<br>
      is discussed in detail in “Transaction Scripts and Script Language” on
      page 131.<br>
      Now, let’s look at Alice’s transaction (shown previously in
      “Transactions—Behind the<br>
      Scenes” on page 118) and see if we can identify the outputs. In the JSON
      encoding,<br>
      the outputs are in an array (list) named vout:<br>
      "vout": [<br>
      {<br>
      "value": 0.01500000,<br>
      "scriptPubKey": "OP_DUP OP_HASH160
      ab68025513c3dbd2f7b92a94e0581f5d50f654e7<br>
      OP_EQUALVERIFY<br>
      OP_CHECKSIG"<br>
      },<br>
      {<br>
      "value": 0.08450000,<br>
      "scriptPubKey": "OP_DUP OP_HASH160
      7f9b1a7fb68d60c536c2fd8aeaa53a8f3cc025a8<br>
      OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG",<br>
      }<br>
      ]<br>
      As you can see, the transaction contains two outputs. Each output is
      defined by a<br>
      value and a cryptographic puzzle. In the encoding shown by Bitcoin Core,
      the value is<br>
      Transaction Outputs and Inputs<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;121<br>
      shown in bitcoin, but in the transaction itself it is recorded as an
      integer denominated<br>
      in satoshis. The second part of each output is the cryptographic puzzle
      that sets the<br>
      conditions for spending. Bitcoin Core shows this as scriptPubKey and shows
      us a<br>
      human-readable representation of the script.<br>
      The topic of locking and unlocking UTXO will be discussed later, in
      “Script Con‐<br>
      struction (Lock + Unlock)” on page 132. The scripting language that is
      used for the<br>
      script in scriptPubKey is discussed in “Transaction Scripts and Script
      Language” on<br>
      page 131. But before we delve into those topics, we need to understand the
      overall<br>
      structure of transaction inputs and outputs.<br>
      Transaction serialization—outputs<br>
      When transactions are transmitted over the network or exchanged between
      applica‐<br>
      tions, they are serialized. Serialization is the process of converting the
      internal repre‐<br>
      sentation of a data structure into a format that can be transmitted one
      byte at a time,<br>
      also known as a byte stream. Serialization is most commonly used for
      encoding data<br>
      structures for transmission over a network or for storage in a file. The
      serialization<br>
      format of a transaction output is shown in Table 6-1.<br>
      Table 6-1. Transaction output serialization<br>

      Most bitcoin libraries and frameworks do not store transactions internally
      as byte-<br>
      streams, as that would require complex parsing every time you needed to
      access a sin‐<br>
      gle field. For convenience and readability, bitcoin libraries store
      transactions<br>
      internally in data structures (usually object-oriented structures).<br>
      The process of converting from the byte-stream representation of a
      transaction to a<br>
      library’s internal representation data structure is called deserialization
      or transaction<br>
      parsing. The process of converting back to a byte-stream for transmission
      over the<br>
      network, for hashing, or for storage on disk is called serialization. Most
      bitcoin libra‐<br>
      ries have built-in functions for transaction serialization and
      deserialization.<br>
      See if you can manually decode Alice’s transaction from the serialized
      hexadecimal<br>
      form, finding some of the elements we saw previously. The section
      containing the two<br>
      outputs is highlighted in Example 6-1 to help you:<br>

      Here are some hints:<br>
      • There are two outputs in the highlighted section, each serialized as
      shown in<br>
      Table 6-1.<br>
      • The value of 0.015 bitcoin is 1,500,000 satoshis. That’s 16 e3 60 in
      hexadecimal.<br>
      • In the serialized transaction, the value 16 e3 60 is encoded in
      little-endian<br>
      (least-significant-byte-first) byte order, so it looks like 60 e3 16.<br>
      • The scriptPubKey length is 25 bytes, which is 19 in hexadecimal.<br>
      Transaction Inputs<br>
      Transaction inputs identify (by reference) which UTXO will be consumed and
      pro‐<br>
      vide proof of ownership through an unlocking script.<br>
      To build a transaction, a wallet selects from the UTXO it controls, UTXO
      with<br>
      enough value to make the requested payment. Sometimes one UTXO is enough,<br>
      other times more than one is needed. For each UTXO that will be consumed
      to make<br>
      this payment, the wallet creates one input pointing to the UTXO and
      unlocks it with<br>
      an unlocking script.<br>
      Let’s look at the components of an input in greater detail. The first part
      of an input is<br>
      a pointer to an UTXO by reference to the transaction hash and sequence
      number<br>
      where the UTXO is recorded in the blockchain. The second part is an
      unlocking<br>
      script, which the wallet constructs in order to satisfy the spending
      conditions set in<br>
      the UTXO. Most often, the unlocking script is a digital signature and
      public key prov‐<br>
      ing ownership of the bitcoin. However, not all unlocking scripts contain
      signatures.<br>
      The third part is a sequence number, which will be discussed later.<br>
      Consider our example in “Transactions—Behind the Scenes” on page 118. The
      trans‐<br>
      action inputs are an array (list) called vin:<br>
      Transaction Outputs and Inputs<br>

      "sequence": 4294967295<br>
      }<br>
      ]<br>
      As you can see, there is only one input in the list (because one UTXO
      contained suffi‐<br>
      cient value to make this payment). The input contains four elements:<br>
      • A transaction ID, referencing the transaction that contains the UTXO
      being<br>
      spent<br>
      • An output index (vout), identifying which UTXO from that transaction is
      refer‐<br>
      enced (first one is zero)<br>
      • A scriptSig, which satisfies the conditions placed on the UTXO,
      unlocking it<br>
      for spending<br>
      • A sequence number (to be discussed later)<br>
      In Alice’s transaction, the input points to the transaction ID:<br>
      7957a35fe64f80d234d76d83a2a8f1a0d8149a41d81de548f0a65a8a999f6f18<br>
      and output index 0 (i.e., the first UTXO created by that transaction). The
      unlocking<br>
      script is constructed by Alice’s wallet by first retrieving the referenced
      UTXO, exam‐<br>
      ining its locking script, and then using it to build the necessary
      unlocking script to<br>
      satisfy it.<br>
      Looking just at the input you may have noticed that we don’t know anything
      about<br>
      this UTXO, other than a reference to the transaction containing it. We
      don’t know its<br>
      value (amount in satoshi), and we don’t know the locking script that sets
      the condi‐<br>
      tions for spending it. To find this information, we must retrieve the
      referenced UTXO<br>
      by retrieving the underlying transaction. Notice that because the value of
      the input is<br>
      not explicitly stated, we must also use the referenced UTXO in order to
      calculate the<br>
      fees that will be paid in this transaction (see “Transaction Fees” on page
      126).<br>
      It’s not just Alice’s wallet that needs to retrieve UTXO referenced in the
      inputs. Once<br>
      this transaction is broadcast to the network, every validating node will
      also need to<br>
      retrieve the UTXO referenced in the transaction inputs in order to
      validate the trans‐<br>
      action.<br>
      124<br>
      &nbsp;| Chapter 6: Transactions<br>
      Transactions on their own seem incomplete because they lack context. They
      reference<br>
      UTXO in their inputs but without retrieving that UTXO we cannot know the
      value of<br>
      the inputs or their locking conditions. When writing bitcoin software,
      anytime you<br>
      decode a transaction with the intent of validating it or counting the fees
      or checking<br>
      the unlocking script, your code will first have to retrieve the referenced
      UTXO from<br>
      the blockchain in order to build the context implied but not present in
      the UTXO<br>
      references of the inputs. For example, to calculate the amount paid in
      fees, you must<br>
      know the sum of the values of inputs and outputs. But without retrieving
      the UTXO<br>
      referenced in the inputs, you do not know their value. So a seemingly
      simple opera‐<br>
      tion like counting fees in a single transaction in fact involves multiple
      steps and data<br>
      from multiple transactions.<br>
      We can use the same sequence of commands with Bitcoin Core as we used when<br>
      retrieving Alice’s transaction (getrawtransaction and
      decoderawtransaction).<br>
      With that we can get the UTXO referenced in the preceding input and take a
      look:<br>
      "vout": [<br>
      {<br>
      "value": 0.10000000,<br>
      "scriptPubKey": "OP_DUP OP_HASH160<br>
      7f9b1a7fb68d60c536c2fd8aeaa53a8f3cc025a8 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG"<br>
      }<br>
      ]<br>
      We see that this UTXO has a value of 0.1 BTC and that it has a locking
      script (script<br>
      PubKey) that contains “OP_DUP OP_HASH160...”.<br>
      To fully understand Alice’s transaction we had to retrieve the previ‐<br>
      ous transaction(s) referenced as inputs. A function that retrieves<br>
      previous transactions and unspent transaction outputs is very com‐<br>
      mon and exists in almost every bitcoin library and API.<br>
      Transaction serialization—inputs<br>
      When transactions are serialized for transmission on the network, their
      inputs are<br>

      ing and the fees and rewards collected by miners are discussed in more
      detail in<br>
      Chapter 10.<br>
      This section examines how transaction fees are included in a typical
      transaction.<br>
      Most wallets calculate and include transaction fees automatically.
      However, if you are<br>
      constructing transactions programmatically, or using a command-line
      interface, you<br>
      must manually account for and include these fees.<br>
      Transaction fees serve as an incentive to include (mine) a transaction
      into the next<br>
      block and also as a disincentive against abuse of the system by imposing a
      small cost<br>
      on every transaction. Transaction fees are collected by the miner who
      mines the block<br>
      that records the transaction on the blockchain.<br>
      Transaction fees are calculated based on the size of the transaction in
      kilobytes, not<br>
      the value of the transaction in bitcoin. Overall, transaction fees are set
      based on mar‐<br>
      ket forces within the bitcoin network. Miners prioritize transactions
      based on many<br>
      different criteria, including fees, and might even process transactions
      for free under<br>
      certain circumstances. Transaction fees affect the processing priority,
      meaning that a<br>
      transaction with sufficient fees is likely to be included in the next
      block mined,<br>
      whereas a transaction with insufficient or no fees might be delayed,
      processed on a<br>
      best-effort basis after a few blocks, or not processed at all. Transaction
      fees are not<br>
      mandatory, and transactions without fees might be processed eventually;
      however,<br>
      including transaction fees encourages priority processing.<br>
      Over time, the way transaction fees are calculated and the effect they
      have on transac‐<br>
      tion prioritization has evolved. At first, transaction fees were fixed and
      constant<br>
      across the network. Gradually, the fee structure relaxed and may be
      influenced by<br>
      market forces, based on network capacity and transaction volume. Since at
      least the<br>
      beginning of 2016, capacity limits in bitcoin have created competition
      between trans‐<br>
      actions, resulting in higher fees and effectively making free transactions
      a thing of the<br>
      past. Zero fee or very low fee transactions rarely get mined and sometimes
      will not<br>
      even be propagated across the network.<br>
      In Bitcoin Core, fee relay policies are set by the minrelaytxfee option.
      The current<br>
      default minrelaytxfee is 0.00001 bitcoin or a hundredth of a millibitcoin
      per kilo‐<br>
      byte. Therefore, by default, transactions with a fee less than 0.0001
      bitcoin are treated<br>
      as free and are only relayed if there is space in the mempool; otherwise,
      they are<br>
      dropped. Bitcoin nodes can override the default fee relay policy by
      adjusting the value<br>
      of minrelaytxfee.<br>
      Any bitcoin service that creates transactions, including wallets,
      exchanges, retail<br>
      applications, etc., must implement dynamic fees. Dynamic fees can be
      implemented<br>
      through a third-party fee estimation service or with a built-in fee
      estimation algo‐<br>
      rithm. If you’re unsure, begin with a third-party service and as you gain

      design and implement your own algorithm if you wish to remove the
      third-party<br>
      dependency.<br>
      Fee estimation algorithms calculate the appropriate fee, based on capacity
      and the<br>
      fees offered by “competing” transactions. These algorithms range from
      simplistic<br>
      (average or median fee in the last block) to sophisticated (statistical
      analysis). They<br>
      estimate the necessary fee (in satoshis per byte) that will give a
      transaction a high<br>
      probability of being selected and included within a certain number of
      blocks. Most<br>
      services offer users the option of choosing high, medium, or low priority
      fees. High<br>
      priority means users pay higher fees but the transaction is likely to be
      included in the<br>
      next block. Medium and low priority means users pay lower transaction fees
      but the<br>
      transactions may take much longer to confirm.<br>
      Many wallet applications use third-party services for fee calculations.
      One popular<br>
      service is http://bitcoinfees.21.co, which provides an API and a visual
      chart showing<br>
      the fee in satoshi/byte for different priorities.<br>
      Static fees are no longer viable on the bitcoin network. Wallets that<br>
      set static fees will produce a poor user experience as transactions<br>
      will often get “stuck” and remain unconfirmed. Users who don’t<br>
      understand bitcoin transactions and fees are dismayed by “stuck”<br>
      transactions because they think they’ve lost their money.<br>
      The chart in Figure 6-2 shows the real-time estimate of fees in 10
      satoshi/byte incre‐<br>
      ments and the expected confirmation time (in minutes and number of blocks)
      for<br>
      transactions with fees in each range. For each fee range (e.g., 61–70
      satoshi/byte), two<br>
      horizontal bars show the number of unconfirmed transactions (1405) and
      total num‐<br>
      ber of transactions in the past 24 hours (102,975), with fees in that
      range. Based on<br>
      the graph, the recommended high-priority fee at this time was 80
      satoshi/byte, a fee<br>
      likely to result in the transaction being mined in the very next block
      (zero block<br>
      delay). For perspective, the median transaction size is 226 bytes, so the
      recommended<br>
      fee for a transaction size would be 18,080 satoshis (0.00018080 BTC).<br>
      The fee estimation data can be retrieved via a simple HTTP REST API, at
      https://<br>
      bitcoinfees.21.co/api/v1/fees/recommended. For example, on the command
      line using<br>
      the curl command:<br>
      $ curl https://bitcoinfees.21.co/api/v1/fees/recommended<br>
      {"fastestFee":80,"halfHourFee":80,"hourFee":60}<br>
      The API returns a JSON object with the current fee estimate for fastest
      confirmation<br>
      (fastestFee), confirmation within three blocks (halfHourFee) and six
      blocks (hour<br>
      Fee), in satoshi per byte.<br>

      Adding Fees to Transactions<br>
      The data structure of transactions does not have a field for fees.
      Instead, fees are<br>
      implied as the difference between the sum of inputs and the sum of
      outputs. Any<br>
      excess amount that remains after all outputs have been deducted from all
      inputs is the<br>
      fee that is collected by the miners:<br>
      Fees = Sum(Inputs) – Sum(Outputs)<br>
      This is a somewhat confusing element of transactions and an important
      point to<br>
      understand, because if you are constructing your own transactions you must
      ensure<br>
      you do not inadvertently include a very large fee by underspending the
      inputs. That<br>
      means that you must account for all inputs, if necessary by creating
      change, or you<br>
      will end up giving the miners a very big tip!<br>
      For example, if you consume a 20-bitcoin UTXO to make a 1-bitcoin payment,
      you<br>
      must include a 19-bitcoin change output back to your wallet. Otherwise,
      the 19-<br>
      bitcoin “leftover” will be counted as a transaction fee and will be
      collected by the<br>
      Transaction Outputs and Inputs<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;129<br>
      miner who mines your transaction in a block. Although you will receive
      priority pro‐<br>
      cessing and make a miner very happy, this is probably not what you
      intended.<br>
      If you forget to add a change output in a manually constructed<br>
      transaction, you will be paying the change as a transaction fee.<br>
      “Keep the change!” might not be what you intended.<br>
      Let’s see how this works in practice, by looking at Alice’s coffee
      purchase again. Alice<br>
      wants to spend 0.015 bitcoin to pay for coffee. To ensure this transaction
      is processed<br>
      promptly, she will want to include a transaction fee, say 0.001. That will
      mean that the<br>
      total cost of the transaction will be 0.016. Her wallet must therefore
      source a set of<br>
      UTXO that adds up to 0.016 bitcoin or more and, if necessary, create
      change. Let’s say<br>
      her wallet has a 0.2-bitcoin UTXO available. It will therefore need to
      consume this<br>
      UTXO, create one output to Bob’s Cafe for 0.015, and a second output with
      0.184 bit‐<br>
      coin in change back to her own wallet, leaving 0.001 bitcoin unallocated,
      as an<br>
      implicit fee for the transaction.<br>
      Now let’s look at a different scenario. Eugenia, our children’s charity
      director in the<br>
      Philippines, has completed a fundraiser to purchase schoolbooks for the
      children. She<br>
      received several thousand small donations from people all around the
      world, totaling<br>
      50 bitcoin, so her wallet is full of very small payments (UTXO). Now she
      wants to<br>
      purchase hundreds of schoolbooks from a local publisher, paying in
      bitcoin.<br>
      As Eugenia’s wallet application tries to construct a single larger payment
      transaction,<br>
      it must source from the available UTXO set, which is composed of many
      smaller<br>
      amounts. That means that the resulting transaction will source from more
      than a<br>
      hundred small-value UTXO as inputs and only one output, paying the book
      pub‐<br>
      lisher. A transaction with that many inputs will be larger than one
      kilobyte, perhaps a<br>
      kilobyte or several kilobytes in size. As a result, it will require a much
      higher fee than<br>
      the median-sized transaction.<br>
      Eugenia’s wallet application will calculate the appropriate fee by
      measuring the size of<br>
      the transaction and multiplying that by the per-kilobyte fee. Many wallets
      will over‐<br>
      pay fees for larger transactions to ensure the transaction is processed
      promptly. The<br>
      higher fee is not because Eugenia is spending more money, but because her
      transac‐<br>
      tion is more complex and larger in size—the fee is independent of the
      transaction’s<br>
      bitcoin value.<br>

      &nbsp;Chapter 6: Transactions<br>
      Transaction Scripts and Script Language<br>
      The bitcoin transaction script language, called Script, is a Forth-like
      reverse-polish<br>
      notation stack-based execution language. If that sounds like gibberish,
      you probably<br>
      haven’t studied 1960s programming languages, but that’s ok—we will explain
      it all in<br>
      this chapter. Both the locking script placed on a UTXO and the unlocking
      script are<br>
      written in this scripting language. When a transaction is validated, the
      unlocking<br>
      script in each input is executed alongside the corresponding locking
      script to see if it<br>
      satisfies the spending condition.<br>
      Script is a very simple language that was designed to be limited in scope
      and exe‐<br>
      cutable on a range of hardware, perhaps as simple as an embedded device.
      It requires<br>
      minimal processing and cannot do many of the fancy things modern
      programming<br>
      languages can do. For its use in validating programmable money, this is a
      deliberate<br>
      security feature.<br>
      Today, most transactions processed through the bitcoin network have the
      form “Pay‐<br>
      ment to Bob’s bitcoin address” and are based on a script called a
      Pay-to-Public-Key-<br>
      Hash script. However, bitcoin transactions are not limited to the “Payment
      to Bob’s<br>
      bitcoin address” script. In fact, locking scripts can be written to
      express a vast variety<br>
      of complex conditions. In order to understand these more complex scripts,
      we must<br>
      first understand the basics of transaction scripts and script language.<br>
      In this section, we will demonstrate the basic components of the bitcoin
      transaction<br>
      scripting language and show how it can be used to express simple
      conditions for<br>
      spending and how those conditions can be satisfied by unlocking scripts.<br>
      Bitcoin transaction validation is not based on a static pattern, but<br>
      instead is achieved through the execution of a scripting language.<br>
      This language allows for a nearly infinite variety of conditions to be<br>
      expressed. This is how bitcoin gets the power of “programmable<br>
      money.”<br>
      Turing Incompleteness<br>
      The bitcoin transaction script language contains many operators, but is
      deliberately<br>
      limited in one important way—there are no loops or complex flow control
      capabili‐<br>
      ties other than conditional flow control. This ensures that the language
      is not Turing<br>
      Complete, meaning that scripts have limited complexity and predictable
      execution<br>
      times. Script is not a general-purpose language. These limitations ensure
      that the lan‐<br>
      guage cannot be used to create an infinite loop or other form of “logic
      bomb” that<br>
      could be embedded in a transaction in a way that causes a
      denial-of-service attack<br>
      against the bitcoin network. Remember, every transaction is validated by
      every full<br>
      Transaction Scripts and Script Language<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;131<br>
      node on the bitcoin network. A limited language prevents the transaction
      validation<br>
      mechanism from being used as a vulnerability.<br>
      Stateless Verification<br>
      The bitcoin transaction script language is stateless, in that there is no
      state prior to<br>
      execution of the script, or state saved after execution of the script.
      Therefore, all the<br>
      information needed to execute a script is contained within the script. A
      script will<br>
      predictably execute the same way on any system. If your system verifies a
      script, you<br>
      can be sure that every other system in the bitcoin network will also
      verify the script,<br>
      meaning that a valid transaction is valid for everyone and everyone knows
      this. This<br>
      predictability of outcomes is an essential benefit of the bitcoin system.<br>
      Script Construction (Lock + Unlock)<br>
      Bitcoin’s transaction validation engine relies on two types of scripts to
      validate trans‐<br>
      actions: a locking script and an unlocking script.<br>
      A locking script is a spending condition placed on an output: it specifies
      the condi‐<br>
      tions that must be met to spend the output in the future. Historically,
      the locking<br>
      script was called a scriptPubKey, because it usually contained a public
      key or bitcoin<br>
      address (public key hash). In this book we refer to it as a “locking
      script” to acknowl‐<br>
      edge the much broader range of possibilities of this scripting technology.
      In most bit‐<br>
      coin applications, what we refer to as a locking script will appear in the
      source code as<br>
      scriptPubKey. You will also see the locking script referred to as a
      witness script (see<br>
      Appendix D) or more generally as a cryptographic puzzle. These terms all
      mean the<br>
      same thing, at different levels of abstraction.<br>
      An unlocking script is a script that “solves,” or satisfies, the
      conditions placed on an<br>
      output by a locking script and allows the output to be spent. Unlocking
      scripts are<br>
      part of every transaction input. Most of the time they contain a digital
      signature pro‐<br>
      duced by the user’s wallet from his or her private key. Historically, the
      unlocking<br>
      script was called scriptSig, because it usually contained a digital
      signature. In most bit‐<br>
      coin applications, the source code refers to the unlocking script as
      scriptSig. You<br>
      will also see the unlocking script referred to as a witness (see Appendix
      D). In this<br>
      book, we refer to it as an “unlocking script” to acknowledge the much
      broader range<br>
      of locking script requirements, because not all unlocking scripts must
      contain signa‐<br>
      tures.<br>
      Every bitcoin validating node will validate transactions by executing the
      locking and<br>
      unlocking scripts together. Each input contains an unlocking script and
      refers to a<br>
      previously existing UTXO. The validation software will copy the unlocking
      script,<br>
      retrieve the UTXO referenced by the input, and copy the locking script
      from that<br>
      UTXO. The unlocking and locking script are then executed in sequence. The
      input is<br>
      valid if the unlocking script satisfies the locking script conditions (see
      “Separate exe‐<br>
      132<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 6: Transactions<br>
      cution of unlocking and locking scripts” on page 136). All the inputs are
      validated<br>
      independently, as part of the overall validation of the transaction.<br>
      Note that the UTXO is permanently recorded in the blockchain, and
      therefore is<br>
      invariable and is unaffected by failed attempts to spend it by reference
      in a new trans‐<br>
      action. Only a valid transaction that correctly satisfies the conditions
      of the output<br>
      results in the output being considered as “spent” and removed from the set
      of<br>
      unspent transaction outputs (UTXO set).<br>
      Figure 6-3 is an example of the unlocking and locking scripts for the most
      common<br>
      type of bitcoin transaction (a payment to a public key hash), showing the
      combined<br>
      script resulting from the concatenation of the unlocking and locking
      scripts prior to<br>
      script validation.<br>
      Figure 6-3. Combining scriptSig and scriptPubKey to evaluate a transaction
      script<br>
      The script execution stack<br>
      Bitcoin’s scripting language is called a stack-based language because it
      uses a data<br>
      structure called a stack. A stack is a very simple data structure that can
      be visualized<br>
      as a stack of cards. A stack allows two operations: push and pop. Push
      adds an item<br>
      on top of the stack. Pop removes the top item from the stack. Operations
      on a stack<br>
      can only act on the topmost item on the stack. A stack data structure is
      also called a<br>
      Last-In-First-Out, or “LIFO” queue.<br>
      The scripting language executes the script by processing each item from
      left to right.<br>
      Numbers (data constants) are pushed onto the stack. Operators push or pop
      one or<br>
      more parameters from the stack, act on them, and might push a result onto
      the stack.<br>
      For example, OP_ADD will pop two items from the stack, add them, and push
      the<br>
      resulting sum onto the stack.<br>
      Conditional operators evaluate a condition, producing a boolean result of
      TRUE or<br>
      FALSE. For example, OP_EQUAL pops two items from the stack and pushes TRUE<br>
      (TRUE is represented by the number 1) if they are equal or FALSE
      (represented by<br>
      zero) if they are not equal. Bitcoin transaction scripts usually contain a
      conditional<br>
      operator, so that they can produce the TRUE result that signifies a valid
      transaction.<br>
      Transaction Scripts and Script Language<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;133<br>
      A simple script<br>
      Now let’s apply what we’ve learned about scripts and stacks to some simple
      examples.<br>
      In Figure 6-4, the script 2 3 OP_ADD 5 OP_EQUAL demonstrates the
      arithmetic addi‐<br>
      tion operator OP_ADD, adding two numbers and putting the result on the
      stack, fol‐<br>
      lowed by the conditional operator OP_EQUAL, which checks that the
      resulting sum is<br>
      equal to 5. For brevity, the OP_ prefix is omitted in the step-by-step
      example. For<br>
      more details on the available script operators and functions, see Appendix
      B.<br>
      Although most locking scripts refer to a public key hash (essentially, a
      bitcoin<br>
      address), thereby requiring proof of ownership to spend the funds, the
      script does not<br>
      have to be that complex. Any combination of locking and unlocking scripts
      that<br>
      results in a TRUE value is valid. The simple arithmetic we used as an
      example of the<br>
      scripting language is also a valid locking script that can be used to lock
      a transaction<br>
      output.<br>
      Use part of the arithmetic example script as the locking script:<br>
      3 OP_ADD 5 OP_EQUAL<br>
      which can be satisfied by a transaction containing an input with the
      unlocking script:<br>
      2<br>
      The validation software combines the locking and unlocking scripts and the
      resulting<br>
      script is:<br>
      2 3 OP_ADD 5 OP_EQUAL<br>
      As we saw in the step-by-step example in Figure 6-4, when this script is
      executed, the<br>
      result is OP_TRUE, making the transaction valid. Not only is this a valid
      transaction<br>
      output locking script, but the resulting UTXO could be spent by anyone
      with the<br>
      arithmetic skills to know that the number 2 satisfies the script.<br>
      Transactions are valid if the top result on the stack is TRUE (noted<br>
      as {0x01}), any other nonzero value, or if the stack is empty after<br>
      script execution. Transactions are invalid if the top value on the<br>
      stack is FALSE (a zero-length empty value, noted as {}) or if script<br>
      execution is halted explicitly by an operator, such as OP_VERIFY,<br>
      OP_RETURN, or a conditional terminator such as OP_ENDIF. See<br>
      Appendix B for details.<br>

      The following is a slightly more complex script, which calculates 2 + 7 —
      3 + 1.<br>
      Notice that when the script contains several operators in a row, the stack
      allows the<br>
      results of one operator to be acted upon by the next operator:<br>
      2 7 OP_ADD 3 OP_SUB 1 OP_ADD 7 OP_EQUAL<br>
      Try validating the preceding script yourself using pencil and paper. When
      the script<br>
      execution ends, you should be left with the value TRUE on the stack.<br>
      Separate execution of unlocking and locking scripts<br>
      In the original bitcoin client, the unlocking and locking scripts were
      concatenated<br>
      and executed in sequence. For security reasons, this was changed in 2010,
      because of<br>
      a vulnerability that allowed a malformed unlocking script to push data
      onto the stack<br>
      and corrupt the locking script. In the current implementation, the scripts
      are exe‐<br>
      cuted separately with the stack transferred between the two executions, as
      described<br>
      next.<br>
      First, the unlocking script is executed, using the stack execution engine.
      If the<br>
      unlocking script is executed without errors (e.g., it has no “dangling”
      operators left<br>
      over), the main stack (not the alternate stack) is copied and the locking
      script is exe‐<br>
      cuted. If the result of executing the locking script with the stack data
      copied from the<br>
      unlocking script is “TRUE,” the unlocking script has succeeded in
      resolving the con‐<br>
      ditions imposed by the locking script and, therefore, the input is a valid
      authorization<br>
      to spend the UTXO. If any result other than “TRUE” remains after execution
      of the<br>
      combined script, the input is invalid because it has failed to satisfy the
      spending con‐<br>
      ditions placed on the UTXO.<br>
      Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH)<br>
      The vast majority of transactions processed on the bitcoin network spend
      outputs<br>
      locked with a Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash or “P2PKH” script. These outputs
      contain a<br>
      locking script that locks the output to a public key hash, more commonly
      known as a<br>
      bitcoin address. An output locked by a P2PKH script can be unlocked
      (spent) by pre‐<br>
      senting a public key and a digital signature created by the corresponding
      private key<br>
      (see “Digital Signatures (ECDSA)” on page 138).<br>
      For example, let’s look at Alice’s payment to Bob’s Cafe again. Alice made
      a payment<br>
      of 0.015 bitcoin to the cafe’s bitcoin address. That transaction output
      would have a<br>
      locking script of the form:<br>
      OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;Cafe Public Key Hash&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG<br>
      The Cafe Public Key Hash is equivalent to the bitcoin address of the cafe,
      without<br>
      the Base58Check encoding. Most applications would show the public key hash
      in hex‐<br>
      adecimal encoding and not the familiar bitcoin address Base58Check format
      that<br>
      begins with a “1.”<br>

      Digital Signatures (ECDSA)<br>
      So far, we have not delved into any detail about “digital signatures.” In
      this section we<br>
      look at how digital signatures work and how they can present proof of
      ownership of a<br>
      private key without revealing that private key.<br>
      The digital signature algorithm used in bitcoin is the Elliptic Curve
      Digital Signature<br>
      Algorithm, or ECDSA. ECDSA is the algorithm used for digital signatures
      based on<br>
      elliptic curve private/public key pairs, as described in “Elliptic Curve
      Cryptography<br>
      Explained” on page 60. ECDSA is used by the script functions OP_CHECKSIG,<br>
      OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY, OP_CHECKMULTISIG, and OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY. Any time<br>
      138<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 6: Transactions<br>
      you see those in a locking script, the unlocking script must contain an
      ECDSA signa‐<br>
      ture.<br>
      A digital signature serves three purposes in bitcoin (see the following
      sidebar). First,<br>
      the signature proves that the owner of the private key, who is by
      implication the<br>
      owner of the funds, has authorized the spending of those funds. Secondly,
      the proof<br>
      of authorization is undeniable (nonrepudiation). Thirdly, the signature
      proves that<br>
      the transaction (or specific parts of the transaction) have not and cannot
      be modified<br>
      by anyone after it has been signed.<br>
      Note that each transaction input is signed independently. This is
      critical, as neither<br>
      the signatures nor the inputs have to belong to or be applied by the same
      “owners.” In<br>
      fact, a specific transaction scheme called “CoinJoin” uses this fact to
      create multi-<br>
      party transactions for privacy.<br>
      Each transaction input and any signature it may contain is com‐<br>
      pletely independent of any other input or signature. Multiple par‐<br>
      ties can collaborate to construct transactions and sign only one<br>
      input each.<br>
      Wikipedia’s Definition of a “Digital Signature”<br>
      A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the
      authenticity of a<br>
      digital message or documents. A valid digital signature gives a recipient
      reason to<br>
      believe that the message was created by a known sender (authentication),
      that the<br>
      sender cannot deny having sent the message (nonrepudiation), and that the
      message<br>
      was not altered in transit (integrity).<br>

      How Digital Signatures Work<br>
      A digital signature is a mathematical scheme that consists of two parts.
      The first part is<br>
      an algorithm for creating a signature, using a private key (the signing
      key), from a<br>
      message (the transaction). The second part is an algorithm that allows
      anyone to ver‐<br>
      ify the signature, given also the message and a public key.<br>
      Creating a digital signature<br>
      In bitcoin’s implementation of the ECDSA algorithm, the “message” being
      signed is<br>
      the transaction, or more accurately a hash of a specific subset of the
      data in the trans‐<br>
      action (see “Signature Hash Types (SIGHASH)” on page 141). The signing key
      is the<br>
      user’s private key. The result is the signature:<br>
      Digital Signatures (ECDSA)<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;139<br>
      Sig = F sig Fhash m , dA<br>
      where:<br>
      • dA is the signing private key<br>
      • m is the transaction (or parts of it)<br>
      • Fhash is the hashing function<br>
      • Fsig is the signing algorithm<br>
      • Sig is the resulting signature<br>
      More details on the mathematics of ECDSA can be found in “ECDSA Math” on
      page<br>
      143.<br>
      The function Fsig produces a signature Sig that is composed of two values,
      commonly<br>
      referred to as R and S:<br>
      Sig = (R, S)<br>
      Now that the two values R and S have been calculated, they are serialized
      into a byte-<br>
      stream using an international standard encoding scheme called the
      Distinguished<br>
      Encoding Rules, or DER.<br>
      Serialization of signatures (DER)<br>
      Let’s look at the transaction Alice created again. In the transaction
      input there is an<br>
      unlocking script that contains the following DER-encoded signature from
      Alice’s wal‐<br>
      let:<br>
3045022100884d142d86652a3f47ba4746ec719bbfbd040a570b1deccbb6498c75c4ae24cb02204b<br>
      9f039ff08df09cbe9f6addac960298cad530a863ea8f53982c09db8f6e381301<br>
      That signature is a serialized byte-stream of the R and S values produced
      by Alice’s<br>
      wallet to prove she owns the private key authorized to spend that output.
      The seriali‐<br>
      zation format consists of nine elements as follows:<br>
      • 0x30—indicating the start of a DER sequence<br>
      • 0x45—the length of the sequence (69 bytes)<br>
      • 0x02—an integer value follows<br>
      • 0x21—the length of the integer (33 bytes)<br>
      • R—<br>

      • 0x02—another integer follows<br>

      • A suffix (0x01) indicating the type of hash used (SIGHASH_ALL)<br>
      See if you can decode Alice’s serialized (DER-encoded) signature using
      this list. The<br>
      important numbers are R and S; the rest of the data is part of the DER
      encoding<br>
      scheme.<br>
      Verifying the Signature<br>
      To verify the signature, one must have the signature (R and S), the
      serialized transac‐<br>
      tion, and the public key (that corresponds to the private key used to
      create the signa‐<br>
      ture). Essentially, verification of a signature means “Only the owner of
      the private key<br>
      that generated this public key could have produced this signature on this
      transaction.”<br>
      The signature verification algorithm takes the message (a hash of the
      transaction or<br>
      parts of it), the signer’s public key and the signature (R and S values),
      and returns<br>
      TRUE if the signature is valid for this message and public key.<br>
      Signature Hash Types (SIGHASH)<br>
      Digital signatures are applied to messages, which in the case of bitcoin,
      are the trans‐<br>
      actions themselves. The signature implies a commitment by the signer to
      specific<br>
      transaction data. In the simplest form, the signature applies to the
      entire transaction,<br>
      thereby committing all the inputs, outputs, and other transaction fields.
      However, a<br>
      signature can commit to only a subset of the data in a transaction, which
      is useful for<br>
      a number of scenarios as we will see in this section.<br>
      Bitcoin signatures have a way of indicating which part of a transaction’s
      data is<br>
      included in the hash signed by the private key using a SIGHASH flag. The
      SIGHASH flag<br>
      is a single byte that is appended to the signature. Every signature has a
      SIGHASH flag<br>
      and the flag can be different from to input to input. A transaction with
      three signed<br>
      inputs may have three signatures with different SIGHASH flags, each
      signature signing<br>
      (committing) different parts of the transaction.<br>
      Remember, each input may contain a signature in its unlocking script. As a
      result, a<br>
      transaction that contains several inputs may have signatures with
      different SIGHASH<br>
      flags that commit different parts of the transaction in each of the
      inputs. Note also<br>
      that bitcoin transactions may contain inputs from different “owners,” who
      may sign<br>
      only one input in a partially constructed (and invalid) transaction,
      collaborating with<br>
      others to gather all the necessary signatures to make a valid transaction.
      Many of the<br>
      SIGHASH flag types only make sense if you think of multiple participants
      collaborating<br>
      outside the bitcoin network and updating a partially signed transaction.<br>
      Digital Signatures (ECDSA)<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;141<br>
      There are three SIGHASH flags: ALL, NONE, and SINGLE, as shown in Table
      6-3.<br>
      Table 6-3. SIGHASH types and their meanings<br>
      SIGHASH flag Value Description<br>
      ALL<br>
      &nbsp;0x01<br>
      &nbsp;Signature applies to all inputs and outputs<br>
      NONE<br>
      &nbsp;0x02<br>
      &nbsp;Signature applies to all inputs, none of the outputs<br>
      SINGLE<br>
      &nbsp;0x03<br>
      &nbsp;Signature applies to all inputs but only the one output with the
      same index number as the signed<br>
      input<br>
      In addition, there is a modifier flag SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY, which can be
      combined<br>
      with each of the preceding flags. When ANYONECANPAY is set, only one input
      is signed,<br>
      leaving the rest (and their sequence numbers) open for modification. The
      ANYONECAN<br>
      PAY has the value 0x80 and is applied by bitwise OR, resulting in the
      combined flags<br>
      as shown in Table 6-4.<br>
      Table 6-4. SIGHASH types with modifiers and their meanings<br>
      SIGHASH flag<br>
      &nbsp;Value Description<br>
      ALL|ANYONECANPAY<br>
      &nbsp;0x81 Signature applies to one inputs and all outputs<br>
      NONE|ANYONECANPAY<br>
      &nbsp;0x82<br>
      &nbsp;Signature applies to one inputs, none of the outputs<br>
      SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY 0x83<br>
      &nbsp;Signature applies to one input and the output with the same index
      number<br>
      The way SIGHASH flags are applied during signing and verification is that
      a copy of the<br>
      transaction is made and certain fields within are truncated (set to zero
      length and<br>
      emptied). The resulting transaction is serialized. The SIGHASH flag is
      added to the end<br>
      of the serialized transaction and the result is hashed. The hash itself is
      the “message”<br>
      that is signed. Depending on which SIGHASH flag is used, different parts
      of the trans‐<br>
      action are truncated. The resulting hash depends on different subsets of
      the data in<br>
      the transaction. By including the SIGHASH as the last step before hashing,
      the signa‐<br>
      ture commits the SIGHASH type as well, so it can’t be changed (e.g., by a
      miner).<br>
      All SIGHASH types sign the transaction nLocktime field (see “Trans‐<br>
      action Locktime (nLocktime)” on page 157). In addition, the SIGH<br>
      ASH type itself is appended to the transaction before it is signed, so<br>
      that it can’t be modified once signed.<br>
      In the example of Alice’s transaction (see the list in “Serialization of
      signatures<br>
      (DER)” on page 140), we saw that the last part of the DER-encoded
      signature was 01,<br>
      which is the SIGHASH_ALL flag. This locks the transaction data, so Alice’s
      signature is<br>
      committing the state of all inputs and outputs. This is the most common
      signature<br>
      form.<br>
      142<br>
      &nbsp;| Chapter 6: Transactions<br>
      Let’s look at some of the other SIGHASH types and how they can be used in
      practice:<br>
      ALL|ANYONECANPAY<br>
      This construction can be used to make a “crowdfunding”-style transaction.<br>
      Someone attempting to raise funds can construct a transaction with a
      single out‐<br>
      put. The single output pays the “goal” amount to the fundraiser. Such a
      transac‐<br>
      tion is obviously not valid, as it has no inputs. However, others can now
      amend it<br>
      by adding an input of their own, as a donation. They sign their own input
      with<br>
      ALL|ANYONECANPAY. Unless enough inputs are gathered to reach the value of
      the<br>
      output, the transaction is invalid. Each donation is a “pledge,” which
      cannot be<br>
      collected by the fundraiser until the entire goal amount is raised.<br>
      NONE<br>
      This construction can be used to create a “bearer check” or “blank check”
      of a<br>
      specific amount. It commits to the input, but allows the output locking
      script to<br>
      be changed. Anyone can write their own bitcoin address into the output
      locking<br>
      script and redeem the transaction. However, the output value itself is
      locked by<br>
      the signature.<br>
      NONE|ANYONECANPAY<br>
      This construction can be used to build a “dust collector.” Users who have
      tiny<br>
      UTXO in their wallets can’t spend these without the cost in fees exceeding
      the<br>
      value of the dust. With this type of signature, the dust UTXO can be
      donated for<br>
      anyone to aggregate and spend whenever they want.<br>
      There are some proposals to modify or expand the SIGHASH system. One such
      pro‐<br>
      posal is Bitmask Sighash Modes by Blockstream’s Glenn Willen, as part of
      the Ele‐<br>
      ments project. This aims to create a flexible replacement for SIGHASH
      types that allows<br>
      “arbitrary, miner-rewritable bitmasks of inputs and outputs” that can
      express “more<br>
      complex contractual precommitment schemes, such as signed offers with
      change in a<br>
      distributed asset exchange.”<br>
      You will not see SIGHASH flags presented as an option in a user’s<br>
      wallet application. With few exceptions, wallets construct P2PKH<br>
      scripts and sign with SIGHASH_ALL flags. To use a different SIGHASH<br>
      flag, you would have to write software to construct and sign trans‐<br>
      actions. More importantly, SIGHASH flags can be used by special-<br>
      purpose bitcoin applications that enable novel uses.<br>
      ECDSA Math<br>
      As mentioned previously, signatures are created by a mathematical function
      Fsig that<br>
      produces a signature composed of two values R and S. In this section we
      look at the<br>
      function Fsig in more detail.<br>
      Digital Signatures (ECDSA)<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;143<br>
      The signature algorithm first generates an ephemeral (temporary) private
      public key<br>
      pair. This temporary key pair is used in the calculation of the R and S
      values, after a<br>
      transformation involving the signing private key and the transaction hash.<br>
      The temporary key pair is based on a random number k, which is used as the
      tempo‐<br>
      rary private key. From k, we generate the corresponding temporary public
      key P (cal‐<br>
      culated as P = k*G, in the same way bitcoin public keys are derived; see
      “Public Keys”<br>
      on page 60). The R value of the digital signature is then the x coordinate
      of the<br>
      ephemeral public key P.<br>
      From there, the algorithm calculates the S value of the signature, such
      that:<br>
      S = k-1 (Hash(m) + dA * R) mod p<br>
      where:<br>
      • k is the ephemeral private key<br>
      • R is the x coordinate of the ephemeral public key<br>
      • dA is the signing private key<br>
      • m is the transaction data<br>
      • p is the prime order of the elliptic curve<br>
      Verification is the inverse of the signature generation function, using
      the R, S values<br>
      and the public key to calculate a value P, which is a point on the
      elliptic curve (the<br>
      ephemeral public key used in signature creation):<br>
      P = S-1 * Hash(m) * G + S-1 * R * Qa<br>
      where:<br>
      • R and S are the signature values<br>
      • Qa is Alice’s public key<br>
      • m is the transaction data that was signed<br>
      • G is the elliptic curve generator point<br>
      If the x coordinate of the calculated point P is equal to R, then the
      verifier can con‐<br>
      clude that the signature is valid.<br>
      Note that in verifying the signature, the private key is neither known nor
      revealed.<br>
      The math of ECDSA is complex and difficult to understand. There<br>
      are a number of great guides online that might help. Search for<br>
      “ECDSA explained” or try this one: http://bit.ly/2r0HhGB.<br>

      &nbsp;Chapter 6: Transactions<br>
      The Importance of Randomness in Signatures<br>
      As we saw in “ECDSA Math” on page 143, the signature generation algorithm
      uses a<br>
      random key k, as the basis for an ephemeral private/public key pair. The
      value of k is<br>
      not important, as long as it is random. If the same value k is used to
      produce two sig‐<br>
      natures on different messages (transactions), then the signing private key
      can be cal‐<br>
      culated by anyone. Reuse of the same value for k in a signature algorithm
      leads to<br>
      exposure of the private key!<br>
      If the same value k is used in the signing algorithm on two different<br>
      transactions, the private key can be calculated and exposed to the<br>
      world!<br>
      This is not just a theoretical possibility. We have seen this issue lead
      to exposure of<br>
      private keys in a few different implementations of transaction-signing
      algorithms in<br>
      bitcoin. People have had funds stolen because of inadvertent reuse of a k
      value. The<br>
      most common reason for reuse of a k value is an improperly initialized
      random-<br>
      number generator.<br>
      To avoid this vulnerability, the industry best practice is to not generate
      k with a<br>
      random-number generator seeded with entropy, but instead to use a
      deterministic-<br>
      random process seeded with the transaction data itself. This ensures that
      each trans‐<br>
      action produces a different k. The industry-standard algorithm for
      deterministic<br>
      initialization of k is defined in RFC 6979, published by the Internet
      Engineering Task<br>
      Force.<br>
      If you are implementing an algorithm to sign transactions in bitcoin, you
      must use<br>
      RFC 6979 or a similarly deterministic-random algorithm to ensure you
      generate a<br>
      different k for each transaction.<br>
      Bitcoin Addresses, Balances, and Other Abstractions<br>
      We began this chapter with the discovery that transactions look very
      different<br>
      “behind the scenes” than how they are presented in wallets, blockchain
      explorers, and<br>
      other user-facing applications. Many of the simplistic and familiar
      concepts from the<br>
      earlier chapters, such as bitcoin addresses and balances, seem to be
      absent from the<br>
      transaction structure. We saw that transactions don’t contain bitcoin
      addresses, per<br>
      se, but instead operate through scripts that lock and unlock discrete
      values of bitcoin.<br>
      Balances are not present anywhere in this system and yet every wallet
      application<br>
      prominently displays the balance of the user’s wallet.<br>
      Bitcoin Addresses, Balances, and Other Abstractions<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;145<br>
      Now that we have explored what is actually included in a bitcoin
      transaction, we can<br>
      examine how the higher-level abstractions are derived from the seemingly
      primitive<br>
      components of the transaction.<br>
      Let’s look again at how Alice’s transaction was presented on a popular
      block explorer<br>
      (Figure 6-7).<br>
      Figure 6-7. Alice’s transaction to Bob’s Cafe<br>
      On the left side of the transaction, the blockchain explorer shows Alice’s
      bitcoin<br>
      address as the “sender.” In fact, this information is not in the
      transaction itself. When<br>
      the blockchain explorer retrieved the transaction it also retrieved the
      previous trans‐<br>
      action referenced in the input and extracted the first output from that
      older transac‐<br>
      tion. Within that output is a locking script that locks the UTXO to
      Alice’s public key<br>
      hash (a P2PKH script). The blockchain explorer extracted the public key
      hash and<br>
      encoded it using Base58Check encoding to produce and display the bitcoin
      address<br>
      that represents that public key.<br>
      Similarly, on the right side, the blockchain explorer shows the two
      outputs; the first to<br>
      Bob’s bitcoin address and the second to Alice’s bitcoin address (as
      change). Once<br>
      again, to create these bitcoin addresses, the blockchain explorer
      extracted the locking<br>
      script from each output, recognized it as a P2PKH script, and extracted
      the public-<br>
      key-hash from within. Finally, the blockchain explorer reencoded that
      public key<br>
      hash with Base58Check to produce and display the bitcoin addresses.<br>
      If you were to click on Bob’s bitcoin address, the blockchain explorer
      would show you<br>
      the view in Figure 6-8.<br>

      Figure 6-8. The balance of Bob’s bitcoin address<br>
      The blockchain explorer displays the balance of Bob’s bitcoin address. But
      nowhere in<br>
      the bitcoin system is there a concept of a “balance.” Rather, the values
      displayed here<br>
      are constructed by the blockchain explorer as follows.<br>
      To construct the “Total Received” amount, the blockchain explorer first
      will decode<br>
      the Base58Check encoding of the bitcoin address to retrieve the 160-bit
      hash of Bob’s<br>
      public key that is encoded within the address. Then, the blockchain
      explorer will<br>
      search through the database of transactions, looking for outputs with
      P2PKH locking<br>
      scripts that contain Bob’s public key hash. By summing up the value of all
      the outputs,<br>
      the blockchain explorer can produce the total value received.<br>
      Constructing the current balance (displayed as “Final Balance”) requires a
      bit more<br>
      work. The blockchain explorer keeps a separate database of the outputs
      that are cur‐<br>
      rently unspent, the UTXO set. To maintain this database, the blockchain
      explorer<br>
      must monitor the bitcoin network, add newly created UTXO, and remove spent<br>
      UTXO, in real time, as they appear in unconfirmed transactions. This is a
      compli‐<br>
      cated process that depends on keeping track of transactions as they
      propagate, as well<br>
      as maintaining consensus with the bitcoin network to ensure that the
      correct chain is<br>
      followed. Sometimes, the blockchain explorer goes out of sync and its
      perspective of<br>
      the UTXO set is incomplete or incorrect.<br>
      From the UTXO set, the blockchain explorer sums up the value of all
      unspent out‐<br>
      puts referencing Bob’s public key hash and produces the “Final Balance”
      number<br>
      shown to the user.<br>
      In order to produce this one image, with these two “balances,” the
      blockchain<br>
      explorer has to index and search through dozens, hundreds, or even
      hundreds of<br>
      thousands of transactions.<br>
      In summary, the information presented to users through wallet
      applications, block‐<br>
      chain explorers, and other bitcoin user interfaces is often composed of
      higher-level<br>
      abstractions that are derived by searching many different transactions,
      inspecting<br>
      their content, and manipulating the data contained within them. By
      presenting this<br>
      simplistic view of bitcoin transactions that resemble bank checks from one
      sender to<br>
      one recipient, these applications have to abstract a lot of underlying
      detail. They<br>
      Bitcoin Addresses, Balances, and Other Abstractions<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;147<br>
      mostly focus on the common types of transactions: P2PKH with SIGHASH_ALL
      sig‐<br>
      natures on every input. Thus, while bitcoin applications can present more
      than 80%<br>
      of all transactions in an easy-to-read manner, they are sometimes stumped
      by trans‐<br>
      actions that deviate from the norm. Transactions that contain more complex
      locking<br>
      scripts, or different SIGHASH flags, or many inputs and outputs,
      demonstrate the<br>
      simplicity and weakness of these abstractions.<br>
      Every day, hundreds of transactions that do not contain P2PKH outputs are
      con‐<br>
      firmed on the blockchain. The blockchain explorers often present these
      with red<br>
      warning messages saying they cannot decode an address. The following link
      contains<br>
      the most recent “strange transactions” that were not fully decoded:
      https://block<br>
      chain.info/strange-transactions.<br>
      As we will see in the next chapter, these are not necessarily strange
      transactions. They<br>
      are transactions that contain more complex locking scripts than the common<br>
      P2PKH. We will learn how to decode and understand more complex scripts and
      the<br>
      applications they support next.<br>

      CHAPTER 7<br>
      Advanced Transactions and Scripting<br>
      Introduction<br>
      In the previous chapter, we introduced the basic elements of bitcoin
      transactions and<br>
      looked at the most common type of transaction script, the P2PKH script. In
      this<br>
      chapter we will look at more advanced scripting and how we can use it to
      build trans‐<br>
      actions with complex conditions.<br>
      First, we will look at multisignature scripts. Next, we will examine the
      second most<br>
      common transaction script, Pay-to-Script-Hash, which opens up a whole
      world of<br>
      complex scripts. Then, we will examine new script operators that add a
      time dimen‐<br>
      sion to bitcoin, through timelocks.<br>
      Multisignature<br>
      Multisignature scripts set a condition where N public keys are recorded in
      the script<br>
      and at least M of those must provide signatures to unlock the funds. This
      is also<br>
      known as an M-of-N scheme, where N is the total number of keys and M is
      the thres‐<br>
      hold of signatures required for validation. For example, a 2-of-3
      multisignature is one<br>
      where three public keys are listed as potential signers and at least two
      of those must<br>
      be used to create signatures for a valid transaction to spend the funds.
      At this time,<br>
      standard multisignature scripts are limited to at most 15 listed public
      keys, meaning<br>
      you can do anything from a 1-of-1 to a 15-of-15 multisignature or any
      combination<br>
      within that range. The limitation to 15 listed keys might be lifted by the
      time this<br>
      book is published, so check the isStandard() function to see what is
      currently<br>
      accepted by the network.<br>
      The general form of a locking script setting an M-of-N multisignature
      condition is:<br>
      M &lt;Public Key 1&gt; &lt;Public Key 2&gt; ... &lt;Public Key N&gt; N
      CHECKMULTISIG<br>
      149<br>
      where N is the total number of listed public keys and M is the threshold
      of required<br>
      signatures to spend the output.<br>
      A locking script setting a 2-of-3 multisignature condition looks like
      this:<br>
      2 &lt;Public Key A&gt; &lt;Public Key B&gt; &lt;Public Key C&gt; 3
      CHECKMULTISIG<br>
      The preceding locking script can be satisfied with an unlocking script
      containing<br>
      pairs of signatures and public keys:<br>
      &lt;Signature B&gt; &lt;Signature C&gt;<br>
      or any combination of two signatures from the private keys corresponding
      to the<br>
      three listed public keys.<br>
      The two scripts together would form the combined validation script:<br>
      &lt;Signature B&gt; &lt;Signature C&gt; 2 &lt;Public Key A&gt; &lt;Public
      Key B&gt; &lt;Public Key C&gt; 3<br>
      CHECKMULTISIG<br>
      When executed, this combined script will evaluate to TRUE if, and only if,
      the<br>
      unlocking script matches the conditions set by the locking script. In this
      case, the<br>
      condition is whether the unlocking script has a valid signature from the
      two private<br>
      keys that correspond to two of the three public keys set as an
      encumbrance.<br>
      A bug in CHECKMULTISIG execution<br>
      There is a bug in CHECKMULTISIG’s execution that requires a slight
      workaround. When<br>
      CHECKMULTISIG executes, it should consume M+N+2 items on the stack as
      parame‐<br>
      ters. However, due to the bug, CHECKMULTISIG will pop an extra value or
      one value<br>
      more than expected.<br>
      Let’s look at this in greater detail using the previous validation
      example:<br>
      &lt;Signature B&gt; &lt;Signature C&gt; 2 &lt;Public Key A&gt; &lt;Public
      Key B&gt; &lt;Public Key C&gt; 3<br>
      CHECKMULTISIG<br>
      First, CHECKMULTISIG pops the top item, which is N (in this example “3”).
      Then it pops<br>
      N items, which are the public keys that can sign. In this example, public
      keys A, B, and<br>
      C. Then, it pops one item, which is M, the quorum (how many signatures are
      needed).<br>
      Here M = 2. At this point, CHECKMULTISIG should pop the final M items,
      which are the<br>
      signatures, and see if they are valid. However, unfortunately, a bug in
      the implemen‐<br>
      tation causes CHECKMULTISIG to pop one more item (M+1 total) than it
      should. The<br>
      extra item is disregarded when checking the signatures so it has no direct
      effect on<br>
      CHECKMULTISIG itself. However, an extra value must be present because if
      it is not<br>
      present, when CHECKMULTISIG attempts to pop on an empty stack, it will
      cause a stack<br>
      error and script failure (marking the transaction as invalid). Because the
      extra item is<br>
      disregarded it can be anything, but customarily 0 is used.<br>
      150<br>

      in every full node, until it was spent. All of these issues make using
      complex locking<br>
      scripts difficult in practice.<br>
      P2SH was developed to resolve these practical difficulties and to make the
      use of<br>
      complex scripts as easy as a payment to a bitcoin address. With P2SH
      payments, the<br>
      complex locking script is replaced with its digital fingerprint, a
      cryptographic hash.<br>
      When a transaction attempting to spend the UTXO is presented later, it
      must contain<br>
      the script that matches the hash, in addition to the unlocking script. In
      simple terms,<br>
      P2SH means “pay to a script matching this hash, a script that will be
      presented later<br>
      when this output is spent.”<br>
      In P2SH transactions, the locking script that is replaced by a hash is
      referred to as the<br>
      redeem script because it is presented to the system at redemption time
      rather than as a<br>
      locking script. Table 7-1 shows the script without P2SH and Table 7-2
      shows the same<br>
      script encoded with P2SH.<br>

      As you can see from the tables, with P2SH the complex script that details
      the condi‐<br>
      tions for spending the output (redeem script) is not presented in the
      locking script.<br>
      Instead, only a hash of it is in the locking script and the redeem script
      itself is presen‐<br>
      ted later, as part of the unlocking script when the output is spent. This
      shifts the bur‐<br>
      den in fees and complexity from the sender to the recipient (spender) of
      the<br>
      transaction.<br>
      Let’s look at Mohammed’s company, the complex multisignature script, and
      the<br>
      resulting P2SH scripts.<br>
      First, the multisignature script that Mohammed’s company uses for all
      incoming pay‐<br>
      ments from customers:<br>
      2 &lt;Mohammed's Public Key&gt; &lt;Partner1 Public Key&gt; &lt;Partner2
      Public Key&gt; &lt;Partner3<br>
      Public Key&gt; &lt;Attorney Public Key&gt; 5 CHECKMULTISIG<br>
      If the placeholders are replaced by actual public keys (shown here as
      520-bit numbers<br>
      starting with 04) you can see that this script becomes very long:<br>

      D238F4D800 5 CHECKMULTISIG<br>
      This entire script can instead be represented by a 20-byte cryptographic
      hash, by first<br>
      applying the SHA256 hashing algorithm and then applying the RIPEMD160
      algo‐<br>
      rithm on the result. The 20-byte hash of the preceding script is:<br>
      54c557e07dde5bb6cb791c7a540e0a4796f5e97e<br>
      A P2SH transaction locks the output to this hash instead of the longer
      script, using<br>
      the locking script:<br>
      HASH160 54c557e07dde5bb6cb791c7a540e0a4796f5e97e EQUAL<br>
      which, as you can see, is much shorter. Instead of “pay to this 5-key
      multisignature<br>
      script,” the P2SH equivalent transaction is “pay to a script with this
      hash.” A customer<br>
      making a payment to Mohammed’s company need only include this much shorter<br>
      locking script in his payment. When Mohammed and his partners want to
      spend this<br>
      UTXO, they must present the original redeem script (the one whose hash
      locked the<br>
      UTXO) and the signatures necessary to unlock it, like this:<br>
      &lt;Sig1&gt; &lt;Sig2&gt; &lt;2 PK1 PK2 PK3 PK4 PK5 5 CHECKMULTISIG&gt;<br>
      The two scripts are combined in two stages. First, the redeem script is
      checked<br>
      against the locking script to make sure the hash matches:<br>
      &lt;2 PK1 PK2 PK3 PK4 PK5 5 CHECKMULTISIG&gt; HASH160 &lt;redeem
      scriptHash&gt; EQUAL<br>
      If the redeem script hash matches, the unlocking script is executed on its
      own, to<br>
      unlock the redeem script:<br>
      &lt;Sig1&gt; &lt;Sig2&gt; 2 PK1 PK2 PK3 PK4 PK5 5 CHECKMULTISIG<br>
      Almost all the scripts described in this chapter can only be implemented
      as P2SH<br>
      scripts. They cannot be used directly in the locking script of a UTXO.<br>
      P2SH Addresses<br>
      Another important part of the P2SH feature is the ability to encode a
      script hash as an<br>
      address, as defined in BIP-13. P2SH addresses are Base58Check encodings of
      the 20-<br>
      byte hash of a script, just like bitcoin addresses are Base58Check
      encodings of the 20-<br>
      byte hash of a public key. P2SH addresses use the version prefix “5,”
      which results in<br>
      Base58Check-encoded addresses that start with a “3.” For example,
      Mohammed’s<br>
      Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH)<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;153<br>
      complex script, hashed and Base58Check-encoded as a P2SH address, becomes<br>
      39RF6JqABiHdYHkfChV6USGMe6Nsr66Gzw. Now, Mohammed can give this “address”
      to<br>
      his customers and they can use almost any bitcoin wallet to make a simple
      payment,<br>
      as if it were a bitcoin address. The 3 prefix gives them a hint that this
      is a special type<br>
      of address, one corresponding to a script instead of a public key, but
      otherwise it<br>
      works in exactly the same way as a payment to a bitcoin address.<br>
      P2SH addresses hide all of the complexity, so that the person making a
      payment does<br>
      not see the script.<br>
      Benefits of P2SH<br>
      The P2SH feature offers the following benefits compared to the direct use
      of complex<br>
      scripts in locking outputs:<br>
      • Complex scripts are replaced by shorter fingerprints in the transaction
      output,<br>
      making the transaction smaller.<br>
      • Scripts can be coded as an address, so the sender and the sender’s
      wallet don’t<br>
      need complex engineering to implement P2SH.<br>
      • P2SH shifts the burden of constructing the script to the recipient, not
      the sender.<br>
      • P2SH shifts the burden in data storage for the long script from the
      output (which<br>
      is in the UTXO set) to the input (stored on the blockchain).<br>
      • P2SH shifts the burden in data storage for the long script from the
      present time<br>
      (payment) to a future time (when it is spent).<br>
      • P2SH shifts the transaction fee cost of a long script from the sender to
      the recipi‐<br>
      ent, who has to include the long redeem script to spend it.<br>
      Redeem Script and Validation<br>
      Prior to version 0.9.2 of the Bitcoin Core client, Pay-to-Script-Hash was
      limited to the<br>
      standard types of bitcoin transaction scripts, by the isStandard()
      function. That<br>
      means that the redeem script presented in the spending transaction could
      only be one<br>
      of the standard types: P2PK, P2PKH, or multisig nature, excluding RETURN
      and P2SH<br>
      itself.<br>
      As of version 0.9.2 of the Bitcoin Core client, P2SH transactions can
      contain any valid<br>
      script, making the P2SH standard much more flexible and allowing for
      experimenta‐<br>
      tion with many novel and complex types of transactions.<br>
      Note that you are not able to put a P2SH inside a P2SH redeem script,
      because the<br>
      P2SH specification is not recursive. While it is technically possible to
      include RETURN<br>
      in a redeem script, as nothing in the rules prevents you from doing so, it
      is of no<br>
      154<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 7: Advanced Transactions and Scripting<br>
      practical use because executing RETURN during validation will cause the
      transaction to<br>
      be marked invalid.<br>
      Note that because the redeem script is not presented to the network until
      you attempt<br>
      to spend a P2SH output, if you lock an output with the hash of an invalid
      redeem<br>
      script it will be processed regardless. The UTXO will be successfully
      locked. However,<br>
      you will not be able to spend it because the spending transaction, which
      includes the<br>
      redeem script, will not be accepted because it is an invalid script. This
      creates a risk,<br>
      because you can lock bitcoin in a P2SH that cannot be spent later. The
      network will<br>
      accept the P2SH locking script even if it corresponds to an invalid redeem
      script,<br>
      because the script hash gives no indication of the script it represents.<br>
      P2SH locking scripts contain the hash of a redeem script, which<br>
      gives no clues as to the content of the redeem script itself. The<br>
      P2SH transaction will be considered valid and accepted even if the<br>
      redeem script is invalid. You might accidentally lock bitcoin in such<br>
      a way that it cannot later be spent.<br>
      Data Recording Output (RETURN)<br>
      Bitcoin’s distributed and timestamped ledger, the blockchain, has
      potential uses far<br>
      beyond payments. Many developers have tried to use the transaction
      scripting lan‐<br>
      guage to take advantage of the security and resilience of the system for
      applications<br>
      such as digital notary services, stock certificates, and smart contracts.
      Early attempts<br>
      to use bitcoin’s script language for these purposes involved creating
      transaction out‐<br>
      puts that recorded data on the blockchain; for example, to record a
      digital fingerprint<br>
      of a file in such a way that anyone could establish proof-of-existence of
      that file on a<br>
      specific date by reference to that transaction.<br>
      The use of bitcoin’s blockchain to store data unrelated to bitcoin
      payments is a con‐<br>
      troversial subject. Many developers consider such use abusive and want to
      discourage<br>
      it. Others view it as a demonstration of the powerful capabilities of
      blockchain tech‐<br>
      nology and want to encourage such experimentation. Those who object to the
      inclu‐<br>
      sion of nonpayment data argue that it causes “blockchain bloat,” burdening
      those<br>
      running full bitcoin nodes with carrying the cost of disk storage for data
      that the<br>
      blockchain was not intended to carry. Moreover, such transactions create
      UTXO that<br>
      cannot be spent, using the destination bitcoin address as a freeform
      20-byte field.<br>
      Because the address is used for data, it doesn’t correspond to a private
      key and the<br>
      resulting UTXO can never be spent; it’s a fake payment. These transactions
      that can<br>
      never be spent are therefore never removed from the UTXO set and cause the
      size of<br>
      the UTXO database to forever increase, or “bloat.”<br>
      In version 0.9 of the Bitcoin Core client, a compromise was reached with
      the intro‐<br>
      duction of the RETURN operator. RETURN allows developers to add 80 bytes
      of nonpay‐<br>
      Data Recording Output (RETURN)<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;155<br>
      ment data to a transaction output. However, unlike the use of “fake” UTXO,
      the<br>
      RETURN operator creates an explicitly provably unspendable output, which
      does not<br>
      need to be stored in the UTXO set. RETURN outputs are recorded on the
      blockchain,<br>
      so they consume disk space and contribute to the increase in the
      blockchain’s size, but<br>
      they are not stored in the UTXO set and therefore do not bloat the UTXO
      memory<br>
      pool and burden full nodes with the cost of more expensive RAM.<br>
      RETURN scripts look like this:<br>
      RETURN &lt;data&gt;<br>
      The data portion is limited to 80 bytes and most often represents a hash,
      such as the<br>
      output from the SHA256 algorithm (32 bytes). Many applications put a
      prefix in front<br>
      of the data to help identify the application. For example, the Proof of
      Existence digital<br>
      notarization service uses the 8-byte prefix DOCPROOF, which is ASCII
      encoded as 44<br>
      4f 43 50 52 4f 4f 46 in hexadecimal.<br>
      Keep in mind that there is no “unlocking script” that corresponds to
      RETURN that<br>
      could possibly be used to “spend” a RETURN output. The whole point of
      RETURN is that<br>
      you can’t spend the money locked in that output, and therefore it does not
      need to be<br>
      held in the UTXO set as potentially spendable—RETURN is provably
      unspendable.<br>
      RETURN is usually an output with a zero bitcoin amount, because any
      bitcoin assigned<br>
      to such an output is effectively lost forever. If a RETURN is referenced
      as an input in a<br>
      transaction, the script validation engine will halt the execution of the
      validation script<br>
      and mark the transaction as invalid. The execution of RETURN essentially
      causes the<br>
      script to “RETURN” with a FALSE and halt. Thus, if you accidentally
      reference a<br>
      RETURN output as an input in a transaction, that transaction is invalid.<br>
      A standard transaction (one that conforms to the isStandard() checks) can
      have<br>
      only one RETURN output. However, a single RETURN output can be combined in
      a<br>
      transaction with outputs of any other type.<br>
      Two new command-line options have been added in Bitcoin Core as of version
      0.10.<br>
      The option datacarrier controls relay and mining of RETURN transactions,
      with the<br>
      default set to “1” to allow them. The option datacarriersize takes a
      numeric argu‐<br>
      ment specifying the maximum size in bytes of the RETURN script, 83 bytes
      by default,<br>
      which, allows for a maximum of 80 bytes of RETURN data plus one byte of
      RETURN<br>
      opcode and two bytes of PUSHDATA opcode.<br>
      RETURN was initially proposed with a limit of 80 bytes, but the limit<br>
      was reduced to 40 bytes when the feature was released. In February<br>
      2015, in version 0.10 of Bitcoin Core, the limit was raised back to<br>
      80 bytes. Nodes may choose not to relay or mine RETURN, or only<br>
      relay and mine RETURN containing less than 80 bytes of data.<br>

      Timelocks<br>
      Timelocks are restrictions on transactions or outputs that only allow
      spending after a<br>
      point in time. Bitcoin has had a transaction-level timelock feature from
      the begin‐<br>
      ning. It is implemented by the nLocktime field in a transaction. Two new
      timelock<br>
      features were introduced in late 2015 and mid-2016 that offer UTXO-level
      timelocks.<br>
      These are CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY.<br>
      Timelocks are useful for postdating transactions and locking funds to a
      date in the<br>
      future. More importantly, timelocks extend bitcoin scripting into the
      dimension of<br>
      time, opening the door for complex multistep smart contracts.<br>
      Transaction Locktime (nLocktime)<br>
      From the beginning, bitcoin has had a transaction-level timelock feature.
      Transaction<br>
      locktime is a transaction-level setting (a field in the transaction data
      structure) that<br>
      defines the earliest time that a transaction is valid and can be relayed
      on the network<br>
      or added to the blockchain. Locktime is also known as nLocktime from the
      variable<br>
      name used in the Bitcoin Core codebase. It is set to zero in most
      transactions to indi‐<br>
      cate immediate propagation and execution. If nLocktime is nonzero and
      below 500<br>
      million, it is interpreted as a block height, meaning the transaction is
      not valid and is<br>
      not relayed or included in the blockchain prior to the specified block
      height. If it is<br>
      above 500 million, it is interpreted as a Unix Epoch timestamp (seconds
      since<br>
      Jan-1-1970) and the transaction is not valid prior to the specified time.
      Transactions<br>
      with nLocktime specifying a future block or time must be held by the
      originating sys‐<br>
      tem and transmitted to the bitcoin network only after they become valid.
      If a transac‐<br>
      tion is transmitted to the network before the specified nLocktime, the
      transaction will<br>
      be rejected by the first node as invalid and will not be relayed to other
      nodes. The use<br>
      of nLocktime is equivalent to postdating a paper check.<br>
      Transaction locktime limitations<br>
      nLocktime has the limitation that while it makes it possible to spend some
      outputs in<br>
      the future, it does not make it impossible to spend them until that time.
      Let’s explain<br>
      that with the following example.<br>
      Alice signs a transaction spending one of her outputs to Bob’s address,
      and sets the<br>
      transaction nLocktime to 3 months in the future. Alice sends that
      transaction to Bob<br>
      to hold. With this transaction Alice and Bob know that:<br>
      • Bob cannot transmit the transaction to redeem the funds until 3 months
      have<br>
      elapsed.<br>
      • Bob may transmit the transaction after 3 months.<br>
      Timelocks<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;157<br>
      However:<br>
      • Alice can create another transaction, double-spending the same inputs
      without a<br>
      locktime. Thus, Alice can spend the same UTXO before the 3 months have<br>
      elapsed.<br>
      • Bob has no guarantee that Alice won’t do that.<br>
      It is important to understand the limitations of transaction nLocktime.
      The only<br>
      guarantee is that Bob will not be able to redeem it before 3 months have
      elapsed.<br>
      There is no guarantee that Bob will get the funds. To achieve such a
      guarantee, the<br>
      timelock restriction must be placed on the UTXO itself and be part of the
      locking<br>
      script, rather than on the transaction. This is achieved by the next form
      of timelock,<br>
      called Check Lock Time Verify.<br>
      Check Lock Time Verify (CLTV)<br>
      In December 2015, a new form of timelock was introduced to bitcoin as a
      soft fork<br>
      upgrade. Based on a specifications in BIP-65, a new script operator called
      CHECK‐<br>
      LOCKTIMEVERIFY (CLTV) was added to the scripting language. CLTV is a per-<br>
      output timelock, rather than a per-transaction timelock as is the case
      with nLocktime.<br>
      This allows for much greater flexibility in the way timelocks are applied.<br>
      In simple terms, by adding the CLTV opcode in the redeem script of an
      output it<br>
      restricts the output, so that it can only be spent after the specified
      time has elapsed.<br>
      While nLocktime is a transaction-level timelock, CLTV is an output-<br>
      based timelock.<br>
      CLTV doesn’t replace nLocktime, but rather restricts specific UTXO such
      that they can<br>
      only be spent in a future transaction with nLocktime set to a greater or
      equal value.<br>
      The CLTV opcode takes one parameter as input, expressed as a number in the
      same<br>
      format as nLocktime (either a block height or Unix epoch time). As
      indicated by the<br>
      VERIFY suffix, CLTV is the type of opcode that halts execution of the
      script if the out‐<br>
      come is FALSE. If it results in TRUE, execution continues.<br>
      In order to lock an output with CLTV, you insert it into the redeem script
      of the out‐<br>
      put in the transaction that creates the output. For example, if Alice is
      paying Bob’s<br>
      address, the output would normally contain a P2PKH script like this:<br>
      DUP HASH160 &lt;Bob's Public Key Hash&gt; EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG<br>
      158<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 7: Advanced Transactions and Scripting<br>
      To lock it to a time, say 3 months from now, the transaction would be a
      P2SH trans‐<br>
      action with a redeem script like this:<br>
      &lt;now + 3 months&gt; CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP DUP HASH160 &lt;Bob's
      Public Key Hash&gt;<br>
      EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG<br>
      where &lt;now + 3 months&gt; is a block height or time value estimated 3
      months from the<br>
      time the transaction is mined: current block height + 12,960 (blocks) or
      current Unix<br>
      epoch time + 7,760,000 (seconds). For now, don’t worry about the DROP
      opcode that<br>
      follows CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY; it will be explained shortly.<br>
      When Bob tries to spend this UTXO, he constructs a transaction that
      references the<br>
      UTXO as an input. He uses his signature and public key in the unlocking
      script of<br>
      that input and sets the transaction nLocktime to be equal or greater to
      the timelock in<br>
      the CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY Alice set. Bob then broadcasts the transaction on
      the bit‐<br>
      coin network.<br>
      Bob’s transaction is evaluated as follows. If the CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY
      parameter Alice<br>
      set is less than or equal the spending transaction’s nLocktime, script
      execution contin‐<br>
      ues (acts as if a “no operation” or NOP opcode was executed). Otherwise,
      script exe‐<br>
      cution halts and the transaction is deemed invalid.<br>
      More precisely, CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY fails and halts execution, marking the
      transac‐<br>
      tion invalid if (source: BIP-65):<br>
      1. the stack is empty; or<br>
      2. the top item on the stack is less than 0; or<br>
      3. the lock-time type (height versus timestamp) of the top stack item and
      the nLock<br>
      time field are not the same; or<br>
      4. the top stack item is greater than the transaction’s nLocktime field;
      or<br>
      5. the nSequence field of the input is 0xffffffff.<br>
      CLTV and nLocktime use the same format to describe timelocks,<br>
      either a block height or the time elapsed in seconds since Unix<br>
      epoch. Critically, when used together, the format of nLocktime<br>
      must match that of CLTV in the inputs—they must both reference<br>
      either block height or time in seconds.<br>
      After execution, if CLTV is satisfied, the time parameter that preceded it
      remains as the<br>
      top item on the stack and may need to be dropped, with DROP, for correct
      execution<br>
      of subsequent script opcodes. You will often see CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY
      followed by<br>
      DROP in scripts for this reason.<br>
      Timelocks<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;159<br>
      By using nLocktime in conjunction with CLTV, the scenario described in
      “Transaction<br>
      locktime limitations” on page 157 changes. Because Alice locked the UTXO
      itself, it is<br>
      now impossible for either Bob or Alice to spend it before the 3-month
      locktime has<br>
      expired.<br>
      By introducing timelock functionality directly into the scripting
      language, CLTV<br>
      allows us to develop some very interesting complex scripts.<br>
      The standard is defined in BIP-65 (CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY).<br>
      Relative Timelocks<br>
      nLocktime and CLTV are both absolute timelocks in that they specify an
      absolute point<br>
      in time. The next two timelock features we will examine are relative
      timelocks in that<br>
      they specify, as a condition of spending an output, an elapsed time from
      the confir‐<br>
      mation of the output in the blockchain.<br>
      Relative timelocks are useful because they allow a chain of two or more
      interdepend‐<br>
      ent transactions to be held off chain, while imposing a time constraint on
      one trans‐<br>
      action that is dependent on the elapsed time from the confirmation of a
      previous<br>
      transaction. In other words, the clock doesn’t start counting until the
      UTXO is recor‐<br>
      ded on the blockchain. This functionality is especially useful in
      bidirectional state<br>
      channels and Lightning Networks, as we will see in “Payment Channels and
      State<br>
      Channels” on page 284.<br>
      Relative timelocks, like absolute timelocks, are implemented with both a
      transaction-<br>
      level feature and a script-level opcode. The transaction-level relative
      timelock is<br>
      implemented as a consensus rule on the value of nSequence, a transaction
      field that is<br>
      set in every transaction input. Script-level relative timelocks are
      implemented with<br>
      the CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (CSV) opcode.<br>
      Relative timelocks are implemented according to the specifications in
      BIP-68, Rela‐<br>
      tive lock-time using consensus-enforced sequence numbers and BIP-112,
      CHECKSE‐<br>
      QUENCEVERIFY.<br>
      BIP-68 and BIP-112 were activated in May 2016 as a soft fork upgrade to
      the consen‐<br>
      sus rules.<br>
      Relative Timelocks with nSequence<br>
      Relative timelocks can be set on each input of a transaction, by setting
      the nSequence<br>
      field in each input.<br>
      Original meaning of nSequence<br>
      The nSequence field was originally intended (but never properly
      implemented) to<br>
      allow modification of transactions in the mempool. In that use, a
      transaction contain‐<br>
      160<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 7: Advanced Transactions and Scripting<br>
      ing inputs with nSequence value below 232 (0xFFFFFFFF) indicated a
      transaction that<br>
      was not yet “finalized.” Such a transaction would be held in the mempool
      until it was<br>
      replaced by another transaction spending the same inputs with a higher
      nSequence<br>
      value. Once a transaction was received whose inputs had an nSequence value
      of 232 it<br>
      would be considered “finalized” and mined.<br>
      The original meaning of nSequence was never properly implemented and the
      value of<br>
      nSequence is customarily set to 232 in transactions that do not utilize
      timelocks. For<br>
      transactions with nLocktime or CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, the nSequence value
      must be<br>
      set to less than 232 for the timelock guards to have effect. Customarily,
      it is set to<br>
      232 – 1 (0xFFFFFFFE).<br>
      nSequence as a consensus-enforced relative timelock<br>
      Since the activation of BIP-68, new consensus rules apply for any
      transaction contain‐<br>
      ing an input whose nSequence value is less than 231 (bit 1&lt;&lt;31 is
      not set). Program‐<br>
      matically, that means that if the most significant (bit 1&lt;&lt;31) is
      not set, it is a flag that<br>
      means “relative locktime.” Otherwise (bit 1&lt;&lt;31 set), the nSequence
      value is reserved<br>
      for other uses such as enabling CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, nLocktime,
      Opt-In-Replace-<br>
      By-Fee, and other future developments.<br>
      Transaction inputs with nSequence values less than 231 are interpreted as
      having a rel‐<br>
      ative timelock. Such a transaction is only valid once the input has aged
      by the relative<br>
      timelock amount. For example, a transaction with one input with an
      nSequence rela‐<br>
      tive timelock of 30 blocks is only valid when at least 30 blocks have
      elapsed from the<br>
      time the UTXO referenced in the input was mined. Since nSequence is a
      per-input<br>
      field, a transaction may contain any number of timelocked inputs, all of
      which must<br>
      have sufficiently aged for the transaction to be valid. A transaction can
      include both<br>
      timelocked inputs (nSequence &lt; 231) and inputs without a relative
      timelock (nSe<br>
      quence &gt;= 231).<br>
      The nSequence value is specified in either blocks or seconds, but in a
      slightly different<br>
      format than we saw used in nLocktime. A type-flag is used to differentiate
      between<br>
      values counting blocks and values counting time in seconds. The type-flag
      is set in<br>
      the 23rd least-significant bit (i.e., value 1&lt;&lt;22). If the type-flag
      is set, then the nSe<br>
      quence value is interpreted as a multiple of 512 seconds. If the type-flag
      is not set, the<br>
      nSequence value is interpreted as a number of blocks.<br>
      When interpreting nSequence as a relative timelock, only the 16 least
      significant bits<br>
      are considered. Once the flags (bits 32 and 23) are evaluated, the
      nSequence value is<br>
      usually “masked” with a 16-bit mask (e.g., nSequence &amp; 0x0000FFFF).<br>
      Figure 7-1 shows the binary layout of the nSequence value, as defined by
      BIP-68.<br>

      The standard is defined in BIP-68, Relative lock-time using
      consensus-enforced<br>
      sequence numbers.<br>
      Relative Timelocks with CSV<br>
      Just like CLTV and nLocktime, there is a script opcode for relative
      timelocks that lev‐<br>
      erages the nSequence value in scripts. That opcode is CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY,
      com‐<br>
      monly referred to as CSV for short.<br>
      The CSV opcode when evaluated in a UTXO’s redeem script allows spending
      only in a<br>
      transaction whose input nSequence value is greater than or equal to the
      CSV parame‐<br>
      ter. Essentially, this restricts spending the UTXO until a certain number
      of blocks or<br>
      seconds have elapsed relative to the time the UTXO was mined.<br>
      As with CLTV, the value in CSV must match the format in the corresponding
      nSe<br>
      quence value. If CSV is specified in terms of blocks, then so must
      nSequence. If CSV is<br>
      specified in terms of seconds, then so must nSequence.<br>
      Relative timelocks with CSV are especially useful when several (chained)
      transactions<br>
      are created and signed, but not propagated, when they’re kept “off-chain.”
      A child<br>
      transaction cannot be used until the parent transaction has been
      propagated, mined,<br>
      and aged by the time specified in the relative timelock. One application
      of this use<br>
      case can be seen in “Payment Channels and State Channels” on page 284 and
      “Routed<br>
      Payment Channels (Lightning Network)” on page 297.<br>
      CSV is defined in detail in BIP-112, CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY.<br>
      Median-Time-Past<br>
      As part of the activation of relative timelocks, there was also a change
      in the way<br>
      “time” is calculated for timelocks (both absolute and relative). In
      bitcoin there is a<br>
      subtle, but very significant, difference between wall time and consensus
      time. Bitcoin<br>

      spective of time. Events on the network do not occur instantaneously
      everywhere.<br>
      Network latency must be factored into the perspective of each node.
      Eventually<br>
      everything is synchronized to create a common ledger. Bitcoin reaches
      consensus<br>
      every 10 minutes about the state of the ledger as it existed in the past.<br>
      The timestamps set in block headers are set by the miners. There is a
      certain degree of<br>
      latitude allowed by the consensus rules to account for differences in
      clock accuracy<br>
      between decentralized nodes. However, this creates an unfortunate
      incentive for min‐<br>
      ers to lie about the time in a block so as to earn extra fees by including
      timelocked<br>
      transactions that are not yet mature. See the following section for more
      information.<br>
      To remove the incentive to lie and strengthen the security of timelocks, a
      BIP was<br>
      proposed and activated at the same time as the BIPs for relative
      timelocks. This is<br>
      BIP-113, which defines a new consensus measurement of time called
      Median-Time-<br>
      Past.<br>
      Median-Time-Past is calculated by taking the timestamps of the last 11
      blocks and<br>
      finding the median. That median time then becomes consensus time and is
      used for<br>
      all timelock calculations. By taking the midpoint from approximately two
      hours in<br>
      the past, the influence of any one block’s timestamp is reduced. By
      incorporating 11<br>
      blocks, no single miner can influence the timestamps in order to gain fees
      from trans‐<br>
      actions with a timelock that hasn’t yet matured.<br>
      Median-Time-Past changes the implementation of time calculations for
      nLocktime,<br>
      CLTV, nSequence, and CSV. The consensus time calculated by
      Median-Time-Past is<br>
      always approximately one hour behind wall clock time. If you create
      timelock trans‐<br>
      actions, you should account for it when estimating the desired value to
      encode in<br>
      nLocktime, nSequence, CLTV, and CSV.<br>
      Median-Time-Past is specified in BIP-113.<br>
      Timelock Defense Against Fee Sniping<br>
      Fee-sniping is a theoretical attack scenario, where miners attempting to
      rewrite past<br>
      blocks “snipe” higher-fee transactions from future blocks to maximize
      their profita‐<br>
      bility.<br>
      For example, let’s say the highest block in existence is block #100,000.
      If instead of<br>
      attempting to mine block #100,001 to extend the chain, some miners attempt
      to<br>
      remine #100,000. These miners can choose to include any valid transaction
      (that<br>
      hasn’t been mined yet) in their candidate block #100,000. They don’t have
      to remine<br>
      the block with the same transactions. In fact, they have the incentive to
      select the<br>
      most profitable (highest fee per kB) transactions to include in their
      block. They can<br>
      include any transactions that were in the “old” block #100,000, as well as
      any transac‐<br>
      Timelocks<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;163<br>
      tions from the current mempool. Essentially they have the option to pull
      transactions<br>
      from the “present” into the rewritten “past” when they re-create block
      #100,000.<br>
      Today, this attack is not very lucrative, because block reward is much
      higher than<br>
      total fees per block. But at some point in the future, transaction fees
      will be the<br>
      majority of the reward (or even the entirety of the reward). At that time,
      this scenario<br>
      becomes inevitable.<br>
      To prevent “fee sniping,” when Bitcoin Core creates transactions, it uses
      nLocktime to<br>
      limit them to the “next block,” by default. In our scenario, Bitcoin Core
      would set<br>
      nLocktime to 100,001 on any transaction it created. Under normal
      circumstances,<br>
      this nLocktime has no effect—the transactions could only be included in
      block<br>
      #100,001 anyway; it’s the next block.<br>
      But under a blockchain fork attack, the miners would not be able to pull
      high-fee<br>
      transactions from the mempool, because all those transactions would be
      timelocked<br>
      to block #100,001. They can only remine #100,000 with whatever
      transactions were<br>
      valid at that time, essentially gaining no new fees.<br>
      To achieve this, Bitcoin Core sets the nLocktime on all new transactions
      to &lt;current<br>
      block # + 1&gt; and sets the nSequence on all the inputs to 0xFFFFFFFE to
      enable nLock<br>
      time.<br>
      Scripts with Flow Control (Conditional Clauses)<br>
      One of the more powerful features of Bitcoin Script is flow control, also
      known as<br>
      conditional clauses. You are probably familiar with flow control in
      various program‐<br>
      ming languages that use the construct IF...THEN...ELSE. Bitcoin
      conditional clauses look<br>
      a bit different, but are essentially the same construct.<br>
      At a basic level, bitcoin conditional opcodes allow us to construct a
      redeem script that<br>
      has two ways of being unlocked, depending on a TRUE/FALSE outcome of
      evaluating a<br>
      logical condition. For example, if x is TRUE, the redeem script is A and
      the ELSE<br>
      redeem script is B.<br>
      Additionally, bitcoin conditional expressions can be “nested”
      indefinitely, meaning<br>
      that a conditional clause can contain another within it, which contains
      another, etc.<br>
      Bitcoin Script flow control can be used to construct very complex scripts
      with hun‐<br>
      dreds or even thousands of possible execution paths. There is no limit to
      nesting, but<br>
      consensus rules impose a limit on the maximum size, in bytes, of a script.<br>
      Bitcoin implements flow control using the IF, ELSE, ENDIF, and NOTIF
      opcodes. Addi‐<br>
      tionally, conditional expressions can contain boolean operators such as
      BOOLAND,<br>
      BOOLOR, and NOT.<br>
      164<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 7: Advanced Transactions and Scripting<br>
      At first glance, you may find the bitcoin’s flow control scripts
      confusing. That is<br>
      because Bitcoin Script is a stack language. The same way that 1 + 1 looks
      “backward”<br>
      when expressed as 1 1 ADD, flow control clauses in bitcoin also look
      “backward.”<br>
      In most traditional (procedural) programming languages, flow control looks
      like this:<br>
      if (condition):<br>
      code to run when condition is true<br>
      else:<br>
      code to run when condition is false<br>
      code to run in either case<br>
      In a stack-based language like Bitcoin Script, the logical condition comes
      before the<br>
      IF, which makes it look “backward,” like this:<br>
      condition<br>
      IF<br>
      code to run when condition is true<br>
      ELSE<br>
      code to run when condition is false<br>
      ENDIF<br>
      code to run in either case<br>
      When reading Bitcoin Script, remember that the condition being evaluated
      comes<br>
      before the IF opcode.<br>
      Conditional Clauses with VERIFY Opcodes<br>
      Another form of conditional in Bitcoin Script is any opcode that ends in
      VERIFY. The<br>
      VERIFY suffix means that if the condition evaluated is not TRUE, execution
      of the<br>
      script terminates immediately and the transaction is deemed invalid.<br>
      Unlike an IF clause, which offers alternative execution paths, the VERIFY
      suffix acts as<br>
      a guard clause, continuing only if a precondition is met.<br>
      For example, the following script requires Bob’s signature and a pre-image
      (secret)<br>
      that produces a specific hash. Both conditions must be satisfied to
      unlock:<br>
      HASH160 &lt;expected hash&gt; EQUALVERIFY &lt;Bob's Pubkey&gt; CHECKSIG<br>
      To redeem this, Bob must construct an unlocking script that presents a
      valid pre-<br>
      image and a signature:<br>
      &lt;Bob's Sig&gt; &lt;hash pre-image&gt;<br>
      Without presenting the pre-image, Bob can’t get to the part of the script
      that checks<br>
      for his signature.<br>
      This script can be written with an IF instead:<br>
      HASH160 &lt;expected hash&gt; EQUAL<br>
      IF<br>
      Scripts with Flow Control (Conditional Clauses)<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;165<br>
      &lt;Bob's Pubkey&gt; CHECKSIG<br>
      ENDIF<br>
      Bob’s unlocking script is identical:<br>
      &lt;Bob's Sig&gt; &lt;hash pre-image&gt;<br>
      The script with IF does the same thing as using an opcode with a VERIFY
      suffix; they<br>
      both operate as guard clauses. However, the VERIFY construction is more
      efficient,<br>
      using one fewer opcode.<br>
      So, when do we use VERIFY and when do we use IF? If all we are trying to
      do is to<br>
      attach a precondition (guard clause), then VERIFY is better. If, however,
      we want to<br>
      have more than one execution path (flow control), then we need an
      IF...ELSE flow<br>
      control clause.<br>
      An opcode such as EQUAL will push the result (TRUE/FALSE) onto<br>
      the stack, leaving it there for evaluation by subsequent opcodes. In<br>
      contrast, the opcode EQUALVERIFY suffix does not leave anything on<br>
      the stack. Opcodes that end in VERIFY do not leave the result on the<br>
      stack.<br>
      Using Flow Control in Scripts<br>
      A very common use for flow control in Bitcoin Script is to construct a
      redeem script<br>
      that offers multiple execution paths, each a different way of redeeming
      the UTXO.<br>
      Let’s look at a simple example, where we have two signers, Alice and Bob,
      and either<br>
      one is able to redeem. With multisig, this would be expressed as a 1-of-2
      multisig<br>
      script. For the sake of demonstration, we will do the same thing with an
      IF clause:<br>
      IF<br>
      &lt;Alice's Pubkey&gt; CHECKSIG<br>
      ELSE<br>
      &lt;Bob's Pubkey&gt; CHECKSIG<br>
      ENDIF<br>
      Looking at this redeem script, you may be wondering: “Where is the
      condition?<br>
      There is nothing preceding the IF clause!”<br>
      The condition is not part of the redeem script. Instead, the condition
      will be offered<br>
      in the unlocking script, allowing Alice and Bob to “choose” which
      execution path they<br>
      want.<br>
      Alice redeems this with the unlocking script:<br>
      &lt;Alice's Sig&gt; 1<br>
      The 1 at the end serves as the condition (TRUE) that will make the IF
      clause execute<br>
      the first redemption path for which Alice has a signature.<br>
      166<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 7: Advanced Transactions and Scripting<br>
      For Bob to redeem this, he would have to choose the second execution path
      by giving<br>
      a FALSE value to the IF clause:<br>
      &lt;Bob's Sig&gt; 0<br>
      Bob’s unlocking script puts a 0 on the stack, causing the IF clause to
      execute the sec‐<br>
      ond (ELSE) script, which requires Bob’s signature.<br>
      Since IF clauses can be nested, we can create a “maze” of execution paths.
      The<br>
      unlocking script can provide a “map” selecting which execution path is
      actually exe‐<br>
      cuted:<br>
      IF<br>
      script A<br>
      ELSE<br>
      IF<br>
      scriptELSE<br>
      scriptENDIF<br>
      ENDIF<br>
      B<br>
      C<br>
      In this scenario, there are three execution paths (script A , script B ,
      and script C).<br>
      The unlocking script provides a path in the form of a sequence of TRUE or
      FALSE val‐<br>
      ues. To select path script B, for example, the unlocking script must end
      in 1 0<br>
      (TRUE, FALSE). These values will be pushed onto the stack, so that the
      second value<br>
      (FALSE) ends up at the top of the stack. The outer IF clause pops the
      FALSE value and<br>
      executes the first ELSE clause. Then the TRUE value moves to the top of
      the stack and<br>
      is evaluated by the inner (nested) IF, selecting the B execution path.<br>
      Using this construct, we can build redeem scripts with tens or hundreds of
      execution<br>
      paths, each offering a different way to redeem the UTXO. To spend, we
      construct an<br>
      unlocking script that navigates the execution path by putting the
      appropriate TRUE<br>
      and FALSE values on the stack at each flow control point.<br>
      Complex Script Example<br>
      In this section we combine many of the concepts from this chapter into a
      single<br>
      example.<br>
      Our example uses the story of Mohammed, the company owner in Dubai who is<br>
      operating an import/export business.<br>
      In this example, Mohammed wishes to construct a company capital account
      with<br>
      flexible rules. The scheme he creates requires different levels of
      authorization depend‐<br>
      ing on timelocks. The participants in the multisig scheme are Mohammed,
      his two<br>
      partners Saeed and Zaira, and their company lawyer Abdul. The three
      partners make<br>
      decisions based on a majority rule, so two of the three must agree.
      However, in the<br>
      Complex Script Example<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;167<br>
      case of a problem with their keys, they want their lawyer to be able to
      recover the<br>
      funds with one of the three partner signatures. Finally, if all partners
      are unavailable<br>
      or incapacitated for a while, they want the lawyer to be able to manage
      the account<br>
      directly.<br>
      Here’s the script that Mohammed designs to achieve this:<br>
      IF<br>
      IF<br>
      2<br>
      ELSE<br>
      &lt;30 days&gt; CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY DROP<br>
      &lt;Abdul the Lawyer's Pubkey&gt; CHECKSIGVERIFY<br>
      1<br>
      ENDIF<br>
      &lt;Mohammed's Pubkey&gt; &lt;Saeed's Pubkey&gt; &lt;Zaira's Pubkey&gt; 3
      CHECKMULTISIG<br>
      ELSE<br>
      &lt;90 days&gt; CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY DROP<br>
      &lt;Abdul the Lawyer's Pubkey&gt; CHECKSIG<br>
      ENDIF<br>
      Mohammed’s script implements three execution paths using nested IF...ELSE
      flow<br>
      control clauses.<br>
      In the first execution path, this script operates as a simple 2-of-3
      multisig with the<br>
      three partners. This execution path consists of lines 3 and 9. Line 3 sets
      the quorum<br>
      of the multisig to 2 (2-of-3). This execution path can be selected by
      putting TRUE<br>
      TRUE at the end of the unlocking script:<br>
      0 &lt;Mohammed's Sig&gt; &lt;Zaira's Sig&gt; TRUE TRUE<br>
      The 0 at the beginning of this unlocking script is because of a bug<br>
      in CHECKMULTISIG that pops an extra value from the stack. The<br>
      extra value is disregarded by the CHECKMULTISIG, but it must be<br>
      present or the script fails. Pushing 0 (customarily) is a workaround<br>
      to the bug, as described in “A bug in CHECKMULTISIG execution”<br>
      on page 150.<br>
      The second execution path can only be used after 30 days have elapsed from
      the cre‐<br>
      ation of the UTXO. At that time, it requires the signature of Abdul the
      lawyer and one<br>
      of the three partners (a 1-of-3 multisig). This is achieved by line 7,
      which sets the<br>
      quorum for the multisig to 1. To select this execution path, the unlocking
      script<br>
      would end in FALSE TRUE:<br>
      0 &lt;Saeed's Sig&gt; &lt;Abdul's Sig&gt; FALSE TRUE<br>
      168<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 7: Advanced Transactions and Scripting<br>
      Why FALSE TRUE? Isn’t that backward? Because the two values are<br>
      pushed on to the stack, with FALSE pushed first, then TRUE pushed<br>
      second. TRUE is therefore popped first by the first IF opcode.<br>
      Finally, the third execution path allows Abdul the lawyer to spend the
      funds alone,<br>
      but only after 90 days. To select this execution path, the unlocking
      script has to end in<br>
      FALSE:<br>
      &lt;Abdul's Sig&gt; FALSE<br>
      Try running the script on paper to see how it behaves on the stack.<br>
      A few more things to consider when reading this example. See if you can
      find the<br>
      answers:<br>
      • Why can’t the lawyer redeem the third execution path at any time by
      selecting it<br>
      with FALSE on the unlocking script?<br>
      • How many execution paths can be used 5, 35, and 105 days, respectively,
      after the<br>
      UTXO is mined?<br>
      • Are the funds lost if the lawyer loses his key? Does your answer change
      if 91 days<br>
      have elapsed?<br>
      • How do the partners “reset” the clock every 29 or 89 days to prevent the
      lawyer<br>
      from accessing the funds?<br>
      • Why do some CHECKSIG opcodes in this script have the VERIFY suffix while
      others<br>
      don’t?<br>

    <h1> Мережа Bitcoin</h1>
    <h3> Мережева архитектура Peer-to-Peer</h3>
    <p> Bitcoin структуровано як мережу peer-to-peer зверху інтернету. Термін
      peer-to-peer, або P2P, означає, що комп'ютери, що приймають участь в
      мережі є сторонами один до одного, що вони всі рівні, що немає “особливих”
      вузлів, та що всі вузли розділяють тягар по запровадженню мережевих
      сервісів. Вузли мережі взаємодіють в решітчастій мережі з “пласкою”
      топологією. Немає сервера, немає централізованого сервісу, та немає
      ієрархії в мережі. Вузли в P2P мережі провадять та споживають послуги
      одночасно, на взаємних засадаї діючи як стимул для участі. Мережі P2P є
      природно стійкими, децентралізованими, та відкритими. Видатним прикладом
      архитектури P2P мережі був самий ранішній інтернет, коли вузли IP мережі
      були рівними. Сьогоднішня архитектура інтернет є більш ієрархічною, але
      протокол інтернета все ще зберігає свою пласко-рівневу основу. </p>
    <p>За межами біткоіна, найширше та найбільш успішне застосування P2P
      технологій є розділення файлів, де Napster був піонером, та BitTorrent
      став найпізнішою еволюцією архитектури.</p>
    <p>Мережева архитектура P2P Bitcoin є більше ніж вибір архитектури. Bitcoin
      є цифровою монетарною системою P2P по задумці, та мережева архітектура
      обоє, є відображення та основа цієї базової характеристики.
      Децентралізація керування є базовим принципом, що може бути досягнуто та
      підтримано пласкою, децентралізованою P2P мережею консенсуса. </p>
    <p> Термін “мережа біткоін” посилається на набір вузлів, що виконують P2P
      протокол біткоіна. На додаток до протокола біткоін P2P, існують також і
      інші протоколи, такі як Stratum, що використовуються для майнингу, та
      легковажних або мобільних гаманців. Ці додаткові протоколи провадяться
      через сервери маршрутизації, що отримують до мережі біткоін, з
      використанням протоколу біткоін P2P, та потім розширюють цю мережу
      вузлами, що виконують інші протоколи. Наприклад, сервери Stratum поєднують
      сервери майнінгу Stratum через протокол Stratum до головної мережі
      біткоін, та перекидають протокол Stratum до протоколу біткоін P2P. Ми
      використовуємо термін “розширена мережа біткоін” для посилання загальної
      мережі, що включає протокол біткоіна P2P, протоколи майнінгових пулів,
      протокол Stratum, та любі інші пов'язані протоколи, що поєднують
      компоненти системи біткоін.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Типи та ролі вузлів</h3>
    <p> Хоча вузли в мережі біткоін P2P є рівними, вони можуть приймати на себе
      різні мови, в залежності від підтримуваної функціональності. Вузол біткоін
      є набором функцій: маршрутизація, база даних блокчейну, майнинг та послуги
      гаманця. Повний вузол з усіма ціма чотирма функціями, показаний на Малюнку
      8-1.</p>
    <p> Малюнок 8-1. Вузол мережі біткоін з усіма чотирма функціями: гаманець,
      майнер, повна база даних блокчена, та мережева маршрутизація<br>
    </p>
    <p>Всі вузли включають функцію маршрутизації, щоб брати участь в мережі, та
      можуть включати іншу функціональність. Всі вузли перевіряють та просувають
      транзакції та блоки, та знаходять і підтримують з'єднання до інших сторін.
      В прикладі повного вузла на Малюнку 8-1, функція маршрутизації позначена
      помаранчевим колом з надписом “Вузол мережевої маршрутизації” або літерою
      “N.”<br>
    </p>
    <p>Деякі вузли, що називаються повними вузлами, також підтримують повну та
      актуальну копію блокчейну. Повні вузли можуть автономно та авторитетно
      веріфікувати любу транзакцію без зовнішніх посилань. Деякі вузли
      обслуговують тільки підмножину блокчейну, та веріфікують транзакції,
      використовуючи метод, що називається спрощеною верифікацією платежів, або
      SPV. Ці вузли відомі як SPV вузли або легковажні вузли. В прикладі повного
      вузла на малюнку, функція зберігання повної бази даних блокчейну позначена
      синім колом з написом “Повний блокчейн”, або літерою “B.” На Малюнку 8-3,
      вузли SPV намальовані без синього кола, показуючи, що вони не мають повної
      копії блокчейна. </p>
    <p> Майнаючі вузли змагаються за створення нових блоків через використання
      спеціалізованого обладнання для вирішення алгоритма доказу виконаної
      роботи. Деякі майнаючі вузли також є повними вузлами, що обслуговують
      повну копію блокчейну, тоді коли інші є легковажними вузлами, що беруть
      участь в майнінгових пулах, та покладаються на сервер пула для підтримки
      повного вузла. Функція майнінгу показана на повному вузлі як корне коло з
      надписом “Майнер” або літерою “M.”</p>
    <p>Користувацькі гаманці можуть бути частиною повного вузла, як це загалом є
      для десктопних клієнтів біткоін. Все більше користувацьких гаманців,
      особливо що виконуються на ообмежених в ресурсах пристроях, як спартфони,
      є SPV вузлами. Функція гаманця показана на Малюнку 8-1 як зелене коло з
      надписом “Гаманець”, або літерою “W.”</p>
    <p> На додаток до головних типів вузлів на протоколі біткоіна P2P, існують
      сервери та вузли, що виконують інші протоколи, такі, як спеціалізовані
      протоколи протоколи майнінгових пулів, та легковажні протоколи доступу
      клієнтів. Малюнок 8-2 показує найбільш загальні типи вузлів для розширеної
      мережі біткоін.</p>
    <h3> Розширена мережа біткоін</h3>
    <p> Головна мережа біткоін, що виконує протокол біткоін P2P, складаєтсья з
      від 5000 до 8000 слухаючих вузлів, що виконують різні версії референсного
      клієнта біткоін (Bitcoin Core), та декілька сотен вузлів, що виконують
      інші реалізації біткоін протоколу P2P, таких як Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin
      Unlimited, BitcoinJ, Lib‐bitcoin, btcd, та bcoin. Неувеликий відсоток
      вузлів мережі біткоін P2P також є майнуючими вузлами, що змагаються в
      процесі майнингу, валідують транзакції, та створюю нові блоки. Різні
      великі компанії взаємодіють з мережею біткоін через виконання повних
      клієнтів на базі клієнта Bitcoin Core, з повною копією блокчейна та
      мережевого вузла, але без майнингу та функцій гаманця. Ці вузли діють як
      прикордонні мережеві маршрутизатори, дозволяючи різноманітні послуги
      (обмін, гаманці, дослідження блоків, обробку торгових платежів), що
      будуються зверху.</p>
    <p> Розширена мережа біткоін включає мережу, що виконує мережевий протокол
      P2P. описаний вище, так само, як і вузли, що виконують спеціалізовані
      протоколи. Приєднані до головної мережі біткоін P2P network є декілька
      серверів пулів, та протокольних шлюзів, що поєднують вузли, які
      використовують різні протоколи. Ці інші вузли здебільшого є вузли пулів
      майнінгу (дивіться Главу 10) та легковажні клієнті гаманців, що не несе
      повної копії блокчейну.</p>
    <p>Малюнок 8-3 показує розширену меержу біткоін з різними типами вузлів,
      серверами-шлюзами, прикордонними маршрутизаторами, та клієнтами гаманців,
      ат різні протоколи, що вони використовують для з'єднання один до одного.</p>

      протоколи</p>
    <h3> Релейні мережі Bitcoin</h3>
    <p> В той час, коли мережа біткоіна P2P прислуговується головним потребам
      широкого різноманіття типів вузлів, він виявляє дуже високу затримку
      мережі для спеціалізованих потреб вузлів майнінгу біткоіна. Майнери
      Bitcoin заохочуються в швидкому змаганні для вирішення проблеми доказу
      виконанної роботи, та розширення блокчейна (дивіться Главу 10). Під час
      цього змагання, майнери біткоін мають мінімізувати час між просуванням
      блока-переможця, та початком наступного раунду змагань. В майнінгу
      мережева затримка напряму пов'язана з рівнем доходів.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Релейна мережа Bitcoin Relay Network є мережею, що намагається
      мінімізувати затримкау в передачі блоків між майнерами. Оригінальна
      Bitcoin Relay Network була створена одним з головних розробників Matt
      Corallo в 2015му році, щоб дозволити синхронізацію блоків між майнерами з
      дуже малою затримкою. Мережа складається з декількох спеціалізованих
      вузлів, розташованих на інфраструктурі Amazon Web Services по всьому
      світі, та призначених для поєднання більшості майнерів та майнінгових
      пулів.</p>
    <p> Оригінальна мережа Bitcoin Relay Network була замінена в 2016му році з
      вступом в дію пришвидшеної системи Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine або
      FIBRE, також створеною розробником Matt Corallo. FIBRE є основаною на UDP
      релейною мережою, що пересилає блоки в мережі з вузлів. FIBRE реалізує
      компактну оптимізацію блоків для подальшого зменшення числа переданих
      даних та мережевої затримки.</p>
    <p>Інша релейна мережа (все ще в фазі пропозиції) є Falcon, базована на
      дослідженнях в Cornell University. Falcon використовує “підрізану
      маршрутизацію”, замість “зберегти та переслати”, щоб зменшити затримку
      через просування блоків по мірі надходження, скоріше, ніж очікувати
      отримки цілого блока. </p>
    <p> Релейні мережі не є заміною для мережі біткоін P2P. Замість цього вони є
      надбудованими мережами, що провадять додаткові поєднання між вузлами з
      спеціальними потребами. Як автостради не є замінником сільських доріг, але
      скоріше скороченнями між двома точками з великим трафіком, ви все ще
      потребуєте малі дороги для виїзду на шосе.</p>
    <h3> Пошук мережі</h3>
    <p>Коли новий вузол розпочинає роботу, він має знайти інші вузли біткоіна в
      мережі, щоб прийняти участь в обміні. Щоб розпочати процес, новий вузол
      має визначити щонайменьше один існуючий вузол в мережі, та під'єднатись до
      нього. Географічне розташування інших вузлів не має значення; топологія
      мережі біткоін географічно невизначена. Таким чином, любі існуючі вузли
      біткоін можуть бути обрані випадково.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Щоб під'єднатись до відомого вузла, вузли встановлюють TCP з'єднання,
      звичайно на порту 8333 (порт, загально відомий, як той, що
      використовується в біткоін), або альтернативний порт, якщо він
      запроваджений. Під час встановлення з'єднання вузол почне з “привітання”
      (дивіться Малюнок 8-4), передаючи повідомлення з версією, що містить
      базову ідентифікуючу інформацію, включаючи:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Версію. Версія протокола біткоін, на якій “розмовляє” клієнт
        (наприклад, 70002)</li>
      <li>Локальні сервіси. Перелік локальних сервісів, що підтримуються вузлом.
        Наразі тільки NODE_NETWORK</li>
      <li>Час. Поточний час</li>
      <li>Віддалена адреса addrYou. Адреса віддаленого вузла, як вона бачиться з
        цього вузла</li>
      <li>Власна адреса addrMe, IP адреса локального вузла, як визначено
        локальним вузлом</li>
      <li>Субверсія, субверсія, що показує тип програмного забезпечення, що
        виконується (напр. /Satoshi:0.9.2.1/)</li>
      <li>Найкраща висота. Висота блоку в блокчейні вузла.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(Дивіться GitHub щодо приклада повідомлення версії мережі).<br>
    </p>
    <p>Повідомлення версії завжди є першим повідомленням, надісланим з кожного
      вузла до іншого, Локальна сторона, отримавши повідомлення версії, буде
      перевіряти надіслану віддаленим вузлом версію, та вирішить, чи віддалений
      вузол є сумісним. Якщо віддалений вузол є сумісним, локальний вузол прийме
      повідомлення версії, та встановить з'єднання, надіславши verack.</p>
    <p>Як новий вузол знаходить інші? Перший метод є запит DNS, використовуючи
      декілька “DNS зернят”, що є DNS серверами, що провадять список IP адрес
      вузлів. Деякі з ціх DNS зерен провадять статичний список IP адрес
      стабільно слухаючих вузлів біткоін. Деякі з DNS зерен є власними
      реалізаціями BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Daemon), що повертає випадковий
      набір зі списку адрес вузлів біткоін, що зібрані краулером або довго
      працюючим вузлом. Клієнт Bitcoin Core містить імена п'яти різних DNS
      зерен. Різноманітність в належності та різноманітність в реалізації різних
      DNS зерен забезпечує високій рівень надійності для початкового процесу
      розкрутки. В клієнті Bitcoin Core опція для використання DNS зернят
      контролюється опцією-перемикачем -dnsseed (встановлений в 1 по замовчанню
      для використання DNS зерен).</p>
    <p>Альтернативно, розпочинаючий роботу вузол, що нічого не знає по мережу,
      має отримати щонайменьше одну IP адресу одного вузла біткоін після чого
      він може встановити з'єднання через подальше дослідження. Можуть бути
      використаний аргумент командного рядка -seednode, щоб з'єднатись до одного
      вузла, тільки для запитів щодо інших вузлів, використовуючи його як
      зернятко. Після того, як початковий вузол-зерно використаний для
      початкового завантаження, клієнт відключається від нього, та використовує
      тільки но отримані сторони. </p>
    <p> Малюнок 8-4. Початкове привітання між сторонами<br>
    </p>
    <p>Коли один або більше з'єднань встановлено, новий вузол буде надсилати
      повідомлення addr, що містить його власну IP аддресу своїм сусідам. Сусіди
      будуть, в свою чергу, перевсилати повідомлення addr до своїх сусідів,
      переконуючись, що новий вузол стане гарно відомим та краще з'єднаним.
      Додатково, тільки що під'єднаний вузол може надіслати getaddr до своїх
      сусідів, запитуючи їх повернути список IP адреси інших сторін. Таким
      чином, вузол може знайти сторони, з якими можна зв'язатись, та
      прорекламувати своє існування в мережі для інших вузлів. Малюнок 8-5
      показує протокол пошуку адрес.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Малюнок 8-5. Просування адрес та виявлення</p>
    <p> Вузол має з'єднатись до декількох різних вузлів, щоб встановити різні
      шляхи в мережі біткоін. Шляхи не надійні&nbsp; — вузли з'являються та
      відходять — так що вузел має продовжувати виявляти нові вузли, по мірі
      втрати старих з'єднань, так само, як і допомагати іншим, коли вони
      розпочинають роботу. Для розкручування потрібне тільки одне з'єднання,
      оскільки перший вузол може запропонувати початкові свідоцтва до відомих
      сторін, та ті вузли можуть надати подальші адреси. Також не має потреби,
      та є марнотратством мережевих ресурсів, під'єднуватись більше ніж до
      декількох вузлів. Після розкручування вузол буде пам'ятати його найбільш
      останні вдалі з'єднання з вузлами, так що якщо він буде перезавантажений,
      він швидко перевстановить з'єднання з його минулою мережею сторін. Якщо не
      один з його відомих сторін не відповідає на запити, вузол може використати
      зерна знову для нового розкручування в мережі.<br>
    </p>
    <p>На вузлі, що виконує Bitcoin Core, ви можете перелічити його з'єднання за
      допомоги команди getpeerinfo:<br>
    </p>

    <p> Щоб перекрити автоматиче керування сторонами, та щоб задати список IP
      адрес, користувачі можуть запровадити опцію -connect=&lt;IPAddress&gt;, та
      вказати одну або більше IP адрес. Якщо використовується ця опція, вузол
      буде тільки з'єднуватись до обраних IP адрес, замість визначати та
      обслуговувати з'єднання зі сторонами автоматично. Якщо по з'єднанню немає
      трафіка, вузли будуть періодично надсилати повідомлення для підтримки
      з'єднання. Якщо вузол не комунікує по з'єднанню більше 90 хвилин,
      вважається, що він відключений, та буде обраний інший. Таким чином, мережа
      динамічно підлаштовується до нестійких вузлів та мережевих проблем, та
      може органічно зростати та зменшуватись без жодного централізованого
      контролю.</p>
    <h3> Повні вузли</h3>
    <p> Повні вузли є такі вузли, що обробляють повний блокчейн з усіма
      транзакціями. Більш точно, вони можливо повинні називатись “вузли з повним
      блокчейном”. В ранішні роки біткоіна всі вузли були повними вузлами, та на
      сьогодні клієнт Bitcoin Core є вузлом з повним блокчейном. Однак в останні
      два роки, з'явились нові форми клієнтів біткоін, що не керують повним
      блокчейном, але виконуються як легковажні клієнти. Ми розглянемо їх в
      наступному розділі.</p>
    <p>Повні вузли блокчейну підтримують повну та актуальну копію блокчейна
      біткоінів з усіма транзакціями, що вони незалежно будують та перевіряють,
      починаючи з самого першого блоку (блоку створення), та будуючи аж до
      останнього відомого блоку в мережі. Пвний вузол блокчейну може незалежно
      та достовірно перевірити любу транзакцію без звертання або покладання на
      любий інший вузол або джерело інформації. Повний вузол блокчейну
      покладається на мережу для отримання оновлень щодо нових блоків або
      транзакцій, які він потім верифікує та вставляє у власну копію блокчейна.
      Виконання повного вузла блокчейна надає вам чистий досвід біткоін:
      незалезжну верифікацію всіх транзакцій без потреби покладатись або
      довіряти любій іншій системі. Легко сказати, чи ви виконуєте повний вузол,
      оскільки це потребує більше ста гігабайт постійного сховища (дискового
      протосру), щоб зберігати повний блокчейн. Якщо вам треба багато диску, та
      це займає два або три дні для синхронізації з мережею, ви виконуєте повний
      вузол. Це ціна за повну незалежність та свободу від центральної влади. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Існує декілька альтернативних реалізацій повного клієна блокчейна,
      побудованих на на різних мовах програмування та системних архитектурах.
      Однак найбільш загальна реалізація є референсний клієнт Bitcoin Core,
      також відомий як клієнт <br>
      Satoshi. Більше ніж 75% вузлів мережі біткоін виконують різні версії
      Bitcoin Core. Він ідентифікується як “Satoshi” в рядку суб-версії, що
      надсилається в повідомленні версії, та показується командою getpeerinfo.
      як ми бачили раніше; наприклад, /Satoshi:0.8.6/.</p>
    <h3> Обмін “інвентарем”</h3>
    <p> Перша річ, що буде робити повний вузол, як тільки він з'єднається з
      іншою стороною, він буде намагатись побудувати повний блокчейн. Якщо це
      новий вузол, він не має блокчейну зовсім, він знає тільки один блок, блок
      творіння, що статично вбудований в клієнтське програмне забезпечення.
      Починаючи з блоку #0 (блок творення), новий вузол буде мати завантажити
      тисячі блоків для синхронізації з мережею, та відтворення повного
      блокчейну.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Процес синхронізації блокчейну починається з повідомлення версії,
      оскільки воно містить BestHeight, поточну висоту блокчейна (кількість
      блоків). Вузол буде дивитись на повідомлення версії від сторін, знати,
      скільки блоків має кожний з них, та бути в змозі порівняти з тим, скільки
      блоків він має в своєму блокчейні.
      Вузли сторін будуть отмінюватись повідомленням getblocks, що містить хеш
      (відтиск) верхнього блоку їхнього локального блокчейну. Один з вузлів буде
      в змозі ідентифікувати отримаинй хеш, як той, що не належить блоку нагорі,
      але скоріше належить старішому блоку, з чого роблячи висновок, що його
      блокчейн довший, ніж його візаві. Сторона, що має довший блокчейн, та має
      більше блоків, ніж інший вузол, може визначити, які блоки потребує інший
      вузол, та має завантажити сотні тисячів блоків для синхронізації з мережою
      та відтворення повного блокчейну. Він визначить перші 500 блоків для
      передачі, та передасть їх хеші з використанням повідомлення inv
      (inventory). Вузол, якому не вистачає ціх блоків, потім буде отримувати
      їх, через віддачу повідомлень getdata, запитуючи повний блок даних, та
      ідентифікуючи запитані блоки з використанням хешів з повідомлення inv.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Давайте уявімо, наприклад, що вузол має тільки блок творіння. Потім він
      отримає повідомлення inv від своїх співрозмовників, що міститиме хеші для
      наступних 500 блоків в ланцюгу. Він почне запитувати блоки в усіх
      підключених сторін, розподіляючи навантаження, та переконуючись, що він не
      перевантажує жодний з вузлів запитами. Вузол відстежує, як багато блоків є
      “в дорозі” на кожне з'єднання, означаючи блоки, що були запрошені, але ще
      не отримані, перевіряючи, що це число не перевищує обмеження
      (MAX_BLOCKS_IN_TRANSIT_PER_PEER). В такий спосіб, якщо йому потрібно
      багато блоків, він буде запитувати тільки нові, та не перевантажувати
      мережу. По мірі отримання кожного блоку, він додається до блокчейну, як ми
      побачимо в Главі 9. По мірі того, як локальний блокчейн відбудовується,
      більше блоків запитується та отримується, та процес продовжується, доки
      вузол не догонить всю іншу мережу.</p>
    <p>Цей процес порівняння локального блокчейну з вузлами, та отримання
      недістаючих блоків, трапляється тільки під час того, як блок знаходиться
      офлайн деякий період часу. В той час, коли вузол знаходився офлайн, та
      пропустив декілька блоків, або цілий місяць, та пропустив декілька тисяч,
      він починає з надсилання getblocks, отримує відповідь inv, та починає
      завантажувати відсутні блоки. Малюнок 8-6 показує протокол інвентарізації
      та просування блоків.<br>

      сторін<br>

    <h3> Вузли спрощеної верифікації Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)</h3>
    <p> Не всі вузли мають можливість зберігати повний блокчейн. Багато Багато
      клієнтів біткоін розроблені щоб виконуватись в простір- та
      потужність-обмежених пристроях, таких, як спартфони, планшети, або
      вбудовані системи. Для таких пристроїв використовується метод спрощеної
      верифікації платежів (SPV), що дозволяє їм оперувати без зберігання
      повного блокчейну. Ці типи клієнтів назіваються SPV клієнтами, або
      легковажними клієнтами. По мірі зростання сприфняття біткоіну, вузли SPV
      стають найбільш загальною формою вузлів біткоін, особливо для гаманців
      біткоін. </p>
    <p>Вузли SPV завантажують тільки заголовки блоків, та не завантажують
      транзакції, включені в кожний блок. Отриманий ланціг блоків, без
      транзакцій, в 1,000 разів меньший, ніж повний блокчейн. SPV вузли не
      можуть побудувати повну картину всіх UTXO, що доступні для витрачання, бо
      вони не знають щодо всіх транзакцій в мережі. SPV вузли перевіряють
      трензакції, використовуючи дещо іншу методологію, що покладається на
      сторони для отримання часткових розрізів маючих відношення частин
      блокчейна на вимогу. Як аналогія, повний вузол подібний до туриста в
      чужому місці, що оснащений детальною картою кожної вулиці та кожної
      адреси. Для порівняння, SPV вузол подубний до туриста в чужому місці, що
      питається випадкових перехожих, де повернути в певному напрямку, знаючи
      лише про головний бульвар. Хоча обоє туристи можуть перевірити наявність
      вулиці, навідавшись до неї, турист без мапи не знає, що розташоване в
      кінці кожної вулиці, та навіть не знає, що існують інші вулиці.
      Розташований перед домом на вулиці Будівельників 10, турист без мапи не
      може знати, чи є ще інші адреси Будівельників 10 в місці, та чи є ця
      адреса вірною. Турист без мапи в кращому випадку запитає досить людей, та
      сподіватись, які з них не намагаються пошуткувати з ним.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> SPV пеервіряє транзакції за посиланням до їх глибини в блокчейні,
      замість їх висоти. В той час, коли повний вузол блокчейну буде будувати
      повний перевірений ланцюг з тісячів блоків, та транзакції досягають низу
      блокчейну (назад в часі) до самого блоку творіння, вузли SPV будуть
      перевіряти ланцюг з усіх блоків (але не всі транзакції), та пов'язувати
      цей ланцюг з транзакцією, що нас цікавить. Наприклад, при дослідженні
      транзакцій в блоці 300,000, повний вузол пов'язує всі 300,000 блоків
      донизу до блока творення, та будує повну базу UTXO, встановлюючи
      валідність транзакції через те, що UTXO залишились невитраченими.</p>
    <p> Вузол SPV не може перевірити, що UTXO не витрачене. Замість цього вузол
      SPV
      буде встановлювати зв'язок між транзакцією та блоком, що містить її,
      використовуючи шлях Меркля (дивіться "Дерева Меркля"). Потім SPV вузол
      очікує, доки він не побачить шість блоків, від 300,001 до 300,006,
      накладені звурху блока, що містить транзакцію, та перевіряє її,
      встановлюючи її глибину під блоками від 300,006 до 300,001. Факт, що інші
      вузли мережі сприйняли блок 300,000, та потім виконали потрібну роботу для
      продукування ще шости блоків зверху для його підтвердження, та одночасно
      що транзакція не була двічі витрачена.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> SPV вузол не може бути переконаний, що транзакція існує в блоці, коли
      транзакція насправді не існує. Вузол SPV встановлює присутність транзакції
      в блоці, запитуючи підтвердження шляху Меркля, та через валідацію
      підтвордження виконаної роботи в ланцюзі блоків. Однак присутність
      транзакції може бути “прихована” від SPV вузла. Вузол SPV однозначно може
      впевнитись, що транзакція існує, але не може перевірити, що транзакція,
      така, як повторне витрачення того самого UTXO, не існує, оскільки він не
      має запису всіх транзакцій. Ця вразливість може біти використана в атаці
      типа відмови в обслуговувані, або для атак подвійного витрачання проти
      вузлів SPV. Щоб захиститись від цього, вузол SPV має випадково
      підключатись до декількох вузлів, щоб підвищити вірогідність, що він має
      з'язок з щонайменьше одним чесним вузлом. Ця потреба в випадкових зв'язках
      означає, що вузли SPV також вразливі до атак розділення мережі, або атак <br>
      Sybil (<em>захаращення мережі псевдонімами, найбільше відома через атаку
        на Tor. прим. перекл.</em>), коли вони під'єднуються до файкових вузлів,
      або фейкових мереж, та на мають доступа до реальної мережі біткоін.</p>
    <p> З більш практичних міркувань, гарно поєднані вузли SPV є досить
      безпечними, утримуючи баланс між потребами в русурсах, практичністю та
      безпекою. Однак для непохитної безпеки ніщо не зрівняється з повним вузлом
      блокчена. Повний вузол блокчейна перевіряє транзакцію через перевірку
      всього ланцюга з тисяч блоків пді нею, щоб гарантувати, що UTXO не витрачений,
      тоді як вузол SPV перевіряє, як глибоко блок похований під блоками нам ним.</p>
    <p> Щоб отримати заголовки блоків, вузли SPV використовують повідомлення
      getheaders, замість getblocks. Відповідаюча сторона буде надсилати до
      2,000 заголовків блоків, використовуючи одне повідомлення headers. В
      іншому процес той же самий, що і використовується повними вузлами для
      отримання повних блоків.&nbsp; Вузли SPV також встановлюють фільтр на
      з'єднання зі сторонами, щоб фільтрувати потік майбутніх блоків та
      транзакцій, надісланих сторонами. Любі цікаві транзакції отримуються з
      використанням запиту getdata. Сторона генерує повідомлення tx, що містить
      транзакції, в якості відповіді. Малюнок 8-7 показує синхронізацію
      заголовків блоків. Оскільки вузли SPV потребують отримувати специфічні
      транзакції, щоб вибірково перевіряти їх, вони також створюють ризик для
      приватності. На відміну від повних вузлів блокчейна, що збирають всі
      транзакції в кожному блоці, запити вузлів SPV щодо специфічних даних
      можуть ненавмисно виказати адресу в вашому гаманці. Наприклад, третя
      сторона, що моніторить мережу, може відстежити всі транзакції, запитані
      гаманцем вузла SPV, та використати це для асоціації адрес біткоіна з
      користувачем цього гаманці, зруйнувавши приватність користувача. </p>
    <p>Малюнок 8-7. Вузол SPV синхронізує аголовки блоків</p>
    <p> Швидко після появи SPV/легковажних вузлів, розробники біткоін додали
      можливість, що називається фільтрами Блума, щоб адресувати ризики
      приватності SPV вузлів. Фільтри Блума дозволяють SPV вузлам отримувати
      підмножину транзакцій, без розкриття, які саме адреси нас цікавлять, через
      механізм фільтрування, що використовує вірогідності, замість фіксованих
      шаблонів.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3> Фільтри Блума</h3>
    <p> Фільтри Блума (або блумівські фільтри) є вірогіднісні фільтри пошуку,
      спосіб описати бажаний шаблон без його явного задання. Фільтри Блума
      пропонують ефективний шлях виражати шаблон пошуку, при цьому захищаючи
      приватність. Вони використовуються SPV вузлами для опитування своїх
      співрозмовників в пошуках транзакцій, відповідаючих специічним шаблонам,
      без розкриття, які саме адреси, ключі або транзакції ми шукаємо.</p>
    <p>В нашій попередній аналогії, турист без мапи питає щодо певної адреси,
      Будівельників 10. Якщо він питає перехожих щодо напрямку до цієї вулиці,
      раніше чи пізніше він знайде напрямок. Блумівській фільтр схожий на запит
      "Чи є якісь вулиці пооблизу, чиї назви закінчуються на Н-К-В?". Запитання,
      як це, користувач розкриває трохи меньше щодо потрібного напрямку, ніж
      запитувати Будівельників 10. Використовуючи цей прийом, турист може
      вказати потірбну адресу в більших деталях, як “завершується на Л-Н-К-В”,
      або меньше деталей, як “завершується на В”. Через зміну точності пошуку,
      турист розкриває більше або меньше інформації, ціною отримання більших або
      меньших результатів. Якщо він запитує менш специфічний шаблон, він отримає
      більше можливих адрес, та кращу приватність, але багато результатів не
      будуть мати відношення. Якщо буде запитаний більш специфічний шаблон, буде
      отримано меньше результатів та втрачено більше приватності. </p>
    <p> Блумівські фільтри служать цій функції, що дозволяє вузлу SPV вказувати
      шаблон пошуку для транзакцій, що можуть бути налаштовані в напрямку
      точності або приватності. Більш специфічний блумівський фільтр продукує
      більш точні результати, але ціною розкриття, в яких шаблонах зацікавлений
      SPV вузол, і, таким чином, розкриваючи адреси, якими володіє гаманець
      користувача. Менш специфічний блумівській фільтр буде продукувати більше
      даних щодо транзакцій, багато не маючих відношення до вузла, але це
      дозволить вузлу підтримувати кращу приватність.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3> Як роблять блумівські фільтри</h3>
    <p> Блумівські фільтри реалізовані як масиви змінної довжини з N бінарних
      цифр (бітових полів), та змінного числа з M хеш функцій. Хеш функції
      розроблені так, щоб завжди продукувати на виході значення від 1 до N,
      відповідно до масиву бінарних цифр. Хеш функції генеруються
      детерміністично, так що любий вузол, що реалізує блумівській фільтр, буде
      завжди використовувати ті самі хеш функції, та отримувати той самий
      результат для однакових даних на вході. Обираючи різну довжину (N)
      блумівськіх фільтрів, та різне число (M) хеш функцій, блумівській фільтр
      може бути налаштований, змінюючи рівень точності, та, таким чином,
      приватності. </p>
    <p> На Малюнку 8-8 ми використовуємо дуже малий масив з 16 біт, та
      встановлюємо три хеш функції, щоб продемонструвати, як робить блумівській
      фільтр. </p>
    <p>Малюнок 8-8. Приклад спрощеного блумівського фільтра, з 16-бітним полем
      та трьома хеш функціями</p>
    <p>Блумівській фільтр ініціалізується так, що масив біт є всі нулі. Щоб
      додати шаблон до блумівського фільтра, шаблон хешується кожною хеш
      функцією по черзі. Застосовуючи першу хеш функцію до вхідних даних дає
      число від 1 до N. <br>
      <br>
      Малюнок 8-10. Додаючи другий шаблон “B” до нашого спрощеного блумівського
      фільтра</p>
    <p>Щоб протестувати, чи шаблон є частиною блумівського фільтра, шаблон
      хешується кожною функцією, та отриманий бітовий шаблон перевіряється по
      бітовому масиву. Якщо всі біти, індексовані хеш функцією, встановлені в 1,
      тоді шаблон, можливо, записаний в блумівській функції. Оскільки біти
      можуть бути встановлені як результат перекриття багатьох шаблонів,
      відповідь не є певною, але скоріше вірогіднісна. В простих виразах,
      позитивне співпадіння блумівського фільтра є "Можливо, так".&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Малюнок 8-11 є прикладом перевірки наявності шаблона “X” в простому
      блумівському фільтрі. Відповідні біти встановлені в 1, так що шаблоно
      можливо співпадає.</p>
    <p>Малюнок 8-11. Перевірка наявності шаблона “X” в блумівському фільтрі. Результат
      є вірогіднісним позитивним співпадінням, що означає "Можливо". <br>
    </p>
    <p>На відміну від цього, якщо шаблон перевіряється по блумівському фільтру,
      та один з бітів встановлений в 0, це напевно означає, що шаблон не
      записаний в блумівському фільтрі. Негативний результат не є вірогідністю,
      це визначеність. Простими словами, негативне співпадіння на блумівському
      фільтрі є "Напевне ні".</p>
    <p>Малюнок 8-12 є прикладом тестування існування шаблона “Y” в простому блумівському
      фільтрі. Один з відповідних біт встановллений в 0, так що шаблон напевне
      не співпадає.</p>
    <p> Малюнок 8-12. Тестування існування шаблону “Y” в блумівському фільтрі.
      Результатом є визначено негативне співпадіння, що означає "Напевне ні".</p>
    <h3> Як SPV вузли використовують блумівські фільтри</h3>
    <p>Блумівські фільтри використовуються для фільтрування транзакцій (та
      блоків, що містять їх), що вузол SPV отримує від сторін, відбираючи тільки
      транзакції, що цікавлять SPV вузол, без розкриття, в яких адресах або
      ключах вони зацікавлені. Вузол SPV буде ініуіалізувати блумівській фільтр
      як “пустий”; в цьому стані блумівській фільтр буде співпадати з любими
      шаблонами. Вузол SPV потім складатиме список всіх адрес, ключів та хешей,
      в яких він зацікавлений. Він робить це, через виділення хеша публічного
      ключа, та хеша скрипта та ID транзакцій з UTXO, що контролюються
      гаманцем.&nbsp; Після цього вузол SPV додає кожний з них до блумівського
      фільтра, так що блумівській фільтр буде “співпадати”, якщо ці шаблони
      представлені в транзакції, без розкриття самих шаблонів.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Потім вузол SPV надсилатиме повідомлення filterload до іншої сторони, що
      містить блумівській фільтр, що треба використовувати в з'єднанні. На тій
      стороні блумівські фільтри перевіряються для кожної входячої транзакції.
      Повний вузол перевіряє декілька частин транзакції з блумівськім фільтром,
      шукаючи співпадіння, включаючи:<br>
      • ID транзакції<br>
      • Компоненти даних з блокуючих скриптів кожного виходу транзакцій (кожний
      ключ та хеш в скрипті)<br>
      • Кожний зі входів транзакції<br>
      • Кожний з компонентів даних сигнатури входящих (або скрипта
      підтвердження)</p>
    <p>Перевіряючи всі ці компоненти, блумівські фільтри можуть бути використані
      для порівняння хешів публічних ключів, скриптів, значень OP_RETURN,
      публічних ключів в сигнатурах, або любій майбутній компоненті смарт
      контракті або складному скрипті.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Після встановлення фільтру сторона буде перевіряти вихід кожної
      транзакції на блумівському фільтрі. Тільки транзакції, що співпадають з
      фільтром, надсилаються до вузла. У відповідь на повідомлення getdata від
      вузла, сторони будуть надсилати повідомлення merkleblock, що містить
      тільки заголовки блоків, для блоків, що співпадають з фільтром та
      мерклівськім шляхом (дивіться “Мерклівські дерева”) для кожної транзакції.
      Інша сторона після цього надсилатиме tx повідомлення, що міститиме
      транзакції, що співпадають з фільтром. По мірі того, як повний вузол
      надсилає транзакції до SPV вузла, вузол SPV відхиляє любі фальшиві
      співпадіння, та використовує потрібні транзакції для оновлення свого
      набору UTXO та баланс в гаманці. По мірі того, як він оновлює свій погляд
      на набір UTXO, він також модифікує блумівській фільтр, щоб співпадати з
      подальшими транзакціями, що посилаються на тільки що знайдені UTXO. Повний
      вузол використовує новий блумівській фільтр для перевірки нових транзакцій,
      та весь процес повторюється.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Налаштування вузла щодо блумівського фільтра може інтерактивно додавати
      шаблони до фільтра, надсилаючи повідомлення filteradd. Щоб очистити
      блумівській фільтр, вузол може надіслати повідомлення filterclear.
      Оскільки неможливо видалити шаблон з блумівського фільтра, вузол має
      очистити та встановити новий блумівській фільтр, якщо деякий шаблон більше
      не потрібний. Мережевий протокол та механізм фільтрування для SPV вузлів
      визначений в BIP-37 (Peer Services).</p>
    <h3> SPV вузли та приватність</h3>
    <p> Вузли, що реалізують SPV, мають слабшу приватність, ніж повний вузол.
      Повний вузол отримує всі транзакції, і, таким чином, не розкриває
      інформацію щодо того, чи використовує він деяку адресу в своєму гаманці.
      SPV вузол отримує фільтрований список транзакцій, що мають відношення до
      адрес, що є в його гаманці. Як результат, він зменшує приватність
      власника. Блумівські фільтри є шляхом для зменьшення втрати приватності.
      Без них вузол SPV буде мати явний список адрес, в яких він зацікавлений,
      створюючи суттєву прогалину в приватності. Однак, навіть з блумівськіми
      фільтрами, супротивник, що мониторить трафік SPV клієнта або напряму
      під'єднаний до нього як вузол P2P мережі, може з часом зібрати досить
      інформації, щоб розпізнати адреси в гаманці SPV клієнта.</p>
    <h3> Зашифровані та аутентифіковані з'єднання</h3>
    <p> Більшість нових користувачів біткоін вважають, що мережеві комунікації
      вузла біткоін є зашифровані. Фактично, оригінальна реалізація біткоін
      комунікує повністю відкрито. Хоча це не головна турбота безпеки повних
      вузлів, це велика проблема для SPV вузлів. Шляхом підвищити приватність
      мережі біткоін P2P, існує два рішення для запровадження шифрування
      комунікацій: транспорт Tor та P2P аутентифікація та шифрування
      BIP-150/151.</p>
    <h3> Транспорт Tor</h3>
    <p> Tor, що означає мережу The Onion Routing, є програмним проектом та
      мережею, що надає шифрування та енкапсуляцію даних, через випадкові
      мережеві шляхи, що пропонує анонімність, невідстежуваність та приватність.
      Bitcoin Core пропонує декілька опцій конфігурації, що дозволяють вам
      виконувати вузол біткоін, надсилаючи трафк через мережу Tor. На додаток,
      Bitcoin Core також може запропоеувати прихований Tor сервіс, дозволяючи
      іншим Tor вузлам з'єднуватись до вашого вузла напряму через Tor.</p>
    <p> В Bitcoin Core версії 0.12, вузол буде надавати прихований Tor сервіс
      автоматично, якщо він буде здатний підключитись до локального Tor сервіса.
      Якщо ви маєте встановлений Tor, та процес Bitcoin Core виконується як
      користувач з адекватними правами для доступу до аутефіканційного кукі Tor,
      він буде робити автоматично. Використовуйте флаг debug для ввімкнення
      налаштування Bitcoin Core для Tor сервісу, ось так:</p>
    <p> $ bitcoind --daemon --debug=tor<br>
    </p>
    <p>Ви маєте побачити “tor: ADD_ONION successful” в журналі, вказуючи, що
      Bitcoin Core додав прихований сервіс до Tor мережі. Ви можете знайти
      більше інструкцій по виконанню Bitcoin Core як прихованого сервісу Tor в
      документації Bitcoin Core (docs/tor.md), та різних інструкціях онлайн.</p>
    <h3> Аутентифікація та шифрування P2P</h3>
    <p> Дві пропозиції Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, BIP-150 та BIP-151,
      додають підтримку для P2P аутентифікації та шифруванняв мережі біткоін
      P2P. Ці два BIP визначають опціональні сервіси, що можуть бути надані
      через сумісні вузли біткоін. BIP-151 дозволяє домовлене шифрування для
      всіх комунікацій між двома вузлами, що підтримують BIP-151.&nbsp; BIP-150
      пропонує опціональну аутентифікацію сторони, що дозволяє вузлам
      вутентифікувати один одного з використанням ECDSA та приватних ключів.
      BIP-150 потребує, щоб перед аутентифікацією два вузли встановили шифроване
      з'єднання через BIP-151.</p>
    <p> Станом на січень 2017, BIP-150 та BIP-151 не реалізовані в&nbsp; Bitcoin
      Core. Однак ці дві пропозиції були реалізовані щонайменьше в одній
      альтернативній реалізації клієнта біткоін, bcoin.</p>
    <p> BIP-150 та BIP-151 дозволяють користувачам виконувати клієнти SPV, що
      під'єднані до довірених повних вузлів, використовуючи шифрування та
      аутентифікацію, для захисту приватності SPV клієнта. На додаток,
      аутентифікація може використовуватись для створення мереж довірених вузлів
      біткоін, та запобігання атакам посередників.&nbsp; Нарешті, шифрування
      P2P, при широкому розгортанні, посилить стійкість біткоіна до аналізу
      трафіка та порушуючих приватність досліджень, особливо в тоталітарних
      країнах, де використання інтернету значно контролюється та
      мониториться.&nbsp; Стандарт визначений в BIP-150 (Peer Authentication) та
      BIP-151 (Peer-to-Peer Communication Encryption).</p>
    <h3> Пули транзакцій</h3>
    <p> Майже кожний вузол в мережі біткоін підтримує тимчасовий список
      непідтверджених транзакцій, що називається пул в пам'яті, мемпул, або пул
      транзакцій. Вузли використовують цей пул для відсліджування транзакцій, що
      відомі для мережі, але доки не включені в блокчейн. Наприклад,
      вузол-гаманець використовує пул транзакцій для відстеження надходячих
      платежів до гаманця користувача, що були отримані мережею, але досі не
      підтверджені. По мірі того, як транзакції додаються та верифікуються, вони
      додаються до пула транзакцій, та розсилаються до сусідніх вузлів, щоб
      просувати їх в мережі. Деякі реалізації також підтримують окремий пул
      загублених транзакцій. Якщо входи транзакції посилаються не транзакцію, що
      досі не відома, така, як відсутній батько, загублена транзакція буде
      тимчасово зберігатись в пулі загублених, доки не з'явиться батьківська
      транзакція.</p>
    <p> Коли транзакція додана до пулу транзакцій, пул загублених перевіряється
      щодо жодних загублених транзакцій, що посилаються на вихід транзакції
      (дитину). Любі співпадаючі загублені транзакції валідуються. Якщо вона
      валідна, вона видаляється з пулу загублених, та додаються до пулу
      транзакцій, замикаючи ланцюг, що почався з батьківської транзакції. В
      світі нової доданої транзакції, що більше не загублена, процес
      повторюється рекурсивно, шукаючи подальших нащадків, доки інших нащадків
      не буде знайдено. На протязі цього процесу, надходження батьківської
      транзакції перемикає каскад реконструкції цілого ланцюга незалежних
      транзакцій, через поєднання загублених транзакцій з їхніми батьками, і так
      далі по ланцюгу. Обоє, пул транзакцій та пул загублених (якщо
      реалізований) зберігаються в локальній пам'яті, та не зберігаються в
      постійному сховищі; скоріше, вони динамічно заповнюються з входящих
      мережевих повідомлень. Коли вузол стартує, обоє пули пусті, та поступово
      заповнюються новими транзакціями, отриманими з мережі. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Деякі реалізації клієнтів біткоін обслуговують базу даних або пул UTXO,
      що є набором всіх невитрачених виходів блокчейну. Хоча ім'я “пул UTXO”
      виглядає подібним до пулу транзакцій, він представляє інший набір даних.
      На відміну від пулів транзакцій та загублених, пул UTXO не ініціалізується
      пустим, та замість цього містить мільйони входжень невитрачених виходів
      транзакцій, все що невитрачено за весь час з самого початку, до блоку
      творення.Пул UTXO може розміщуватись в локальній пам'яті, або як
      індексована база даних в постійному сховищі.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Хоча пули транзакцій та загублених представляють локальну перспективу
      поодинокого вузла, та можуть значно варіюватись від вузла до вузла, в
      залежності від того, коли вузол був стартований або рестартований, пул
      UTXO представляє досягнутий консенсус мережі, і, таким чином, може
      розрізнятись тільки незначно між вузлами. Більше того, пули транзакцій та
      загублених містять тільки непідтверджені транзакції, тоді як пул UTXO
      містить тільки підтверджені транзакції.<br>

    <h3> Вступ</h3>
    <p> The blockchain data structure is an ordered, back-linked list of blocks
      of transactions.<br>
      The blockchain can be stored as a flat file, or in a simple database. The
      Bitcoin Core<br>
      client stores the blockchain metadata using Google’s LevelDB database.
      Blocks are<br>
      linked “back,” each referring to the previous block in the chain. The
      blockchain is<br>
      often visualized as a vertical stack, with blocks layered on top of each
      other and the<br>
      first block serving as the foundation of the stack. The visualization of
      blocks stacked<br>
      on top of each other results in the use of terms such as “height” to refer
      to the dis‐<br>
      tance from the first block, and “top” or “tip” to refer to the most
      recently added block.<br>
      Each block within the blockchain is identified by a hash, generated using
      the SHA256<br>
      cryptographic hash algorithm on the header of the block. Each block also
      references a<br>
      previous block, known as the parent block, through the “previous block
      hash” field in<br>
      the block header. In other words, each block contains the hash of its
      parent inside its<br>
      own header. The sequence of hashes linking each block to its parent
      creates a chain<br>
      going back all the way to the first block ever created, known as the
      genesis block.<br>
      Although a block has just one parent, it can temporarily have multiple
      children. Each<br>
      of the children refers to the same block as its parent and contains the
      same (parent)<br>
      hash in the “previous block hash” field. Multiple children arise during a
      blockchain<br>
      “fork,” a temporary situation that occurs when different blocks are
      discovered almost<br>
      simultaneously by different miners (see “Blockchain Forks” on page 240).
      Eventually,<br>
      only one child block becomes part of the blockchain and the “fork” is
      resolved. Even<br>
      though a block may have more than one child, each block can have only one
      parent.<br>
      This is because a block has one single “previous block hash” field
      referencing its single<br>
      parent.<br>
      195<br>
      The “previous block hash” field is inside the block header and thereby
      affects the cur‐<br>
      rent block’s hash. The child’s own identity changes if the parent’s
      identity changes.<br>
      When the parent is modified in any way, the parent’s hash changes. The
      parent’s<br>
      changed hash necessitates a change in the “previous block hash” pointer of
      the child.<br>
      This in turn causes the child’s hash to change, which requires a change in
      the pointer<br>
      of the grandchild, which in turn changes the grandchild, and so on. This
      cascade<br>
      effect ensures that once a block has many generations following it, it
      cannot be<br>
      changed without forcing a recalculation of all subsequent blocks. Because
      such a<br>
      recalculation would require enormous computation (and therefore energy
      consump‐<br>
      tion), the existence of a long chain of blocks makes the blockchain’s deep
      history<br>
      immutable, which is a key feature of bitcoin’s security.<br>
      One way to think about the blockchain is like layers in a geological
      formation, or gla‐<br>
      cier core sample. The surface layers might change with the seasons, or
      even be blown<br>
      away before they have time to settle. But once you go a few inches deep,
      geological<br>
      layers become more and more stable. By the time you look a few hundred
      feet down,<br>
      you are looking at a snapshot of the past that has remained undisturbed
      for millions<br>
      of years. In the blockchain, the most recent few blocks might be revised
      if there is a<br>
      chain recalculation due to a fork. The top six blocks are like a few
      inches of topsoil.<br>
      But once you go more deeply into the blockchain, beyond six blocks, blocks
      are less<br>
      and less likely to change. After 100 blocks back there is so much
      stability that the<br>
      coinbase transaction—the transaction containing newly mined bitcoin—can be
      spent.<br>
      A few thousand blocks back (a month) and the blockchain is settled
      history, for all<br>
      practical purposes. While the protocol always allows a chain to be undone
      by a longer<br>
      chain and while the possibility of any block being reversed always exists,
      the probabil‐<br>
      ity of such an event decreases as time passes until it becomes
      infinitesimal.<br>
      Structure of a Block<br>
      A block is a container data structure that aggregates transactions for
      inclusion in the<br>
      public ledger, the blockchain. The block is made of a header, containing
      metadata,<br>
      followed by a long list of transactions that make up the bulk of its size.
      The block<br>
      header is 80 bytes, whereas the average transaction is at least 250 bytes
      and the aver‐<br>
      age block contains more than 500 transactions. A complete block, with all
      transac‐<br>
      tions, is therefore 1,000 times larger than the block header. Table 9-1
      describes the<br>
      structure of a block.<br>

      Block Header<br>
      The block header consists of three sets of block metadata. First, there is
      a reference to<br>
      a previous block hash, which connects this block to the previous block in
      the block‐<br>
      chain. The second set of metadata, namely the difficulty, timestamp, and
      nonce, relate<br>
      to the mining competition, as detailed in Chapter 10. The third piece of
      metadata is<br>
      the merkle tree root, a data structure used to efficiently summarize all
      the transac‐<br>
      tions in the block. Table 9-2 describes the structure of a block header.<br>

      Block Identifiers: Block Header Hash and Block Height<br>
      The primary identifier of a block is its cryptographic hash, a digital
      fingerprint, made<br>
      by hashing the block header twice through the SHA256 algorithm. The
      resulting 32-<br>
      byte hash is called the block hash but is more accurately the block header
      hash,<br>
      because only the block header is used to compute it. For example,<br>
      000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f is the<br>
      block hash of the first bitcoin block ever created. The block hash
      identifies a block<br>
      uniquely and unambiguously and can be independently derived by any node by
      sim‐<br>
      ply hashing the block header.<br>
      Block Header<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;197<br>
      Note that the block hash is not actually included inside the block’s data
      structure, nei‐<br>
      ther when the block is transmitted on the network, nor when it is stored
      on a node’s<br>
      persistence storage as part of the blockchain. Instead, the block’s hash
      is computed by<br>
      each node as the block is received from the network. The block hash might
      be stored<br>
      in a separate database table as part of the block’s metadata, to
      facilitate indexing and<br>
      faster retrieval of blocks from disk.<br>
      A second way to identify a block is by its position in the blockchain,
      called the block<br>
      height. The first block ever created is at block height 0 (zero) and is
      the same block<br>
      that<br>
      &nbsp;was<br>
      &nbsp;previously<br>
      &nbsp;referenced<br>
      &nbsp;by<br>
      &nbsp;the<br>
      &nbsp;following<br>
      &nbsp;block<br>
      &nbsp;hash<br>
      000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f. A block<br>
      can thus be identified two ways: by referencing the block hash or by
      referencing the<br>
      block height. Each subsequent block added “on top” of that first block is
      one position<br>
      “higher” in the blockchain, like boxes stacked one on top of the other.
      The block<br>
      height on January 1, 2017 was approximately 446,000, meaning there were
      446,000<br>
      blocks stacked on top of the first block created in January 2009.<br>
      Unlike the block hash, the block height is not a unique identifier.
      Although a single<br>
      block will always have a specific and invariant block height, the reverse
      is not true—<br>
      the block height does not always identify a single block. Two or more
      blocks might<br>
      have the same block height, competing for the same position in the
      blockchain. This<br>
      scenario is discussed in detail in the section “Blockchain Forks” on page
      240. The<br>
      block height is also not a part of the block’s data structure; it is not
      stored within the<br>
      block. Each node dynamically identifies a block’s position (height) in the
      blockchain<br>
      when it is received from the bitcoin network. The block height might also
      be stored as<br>
      metadata in an indexed database table for faster retrieval.<br>
      A block’s block hash always identifies a single block uniquely. A<br>
      block also always has a specific block height. However, it is not<br>
      always the case that a specific block height can identify a single<br>
      block. Rather, two or more blocks might compete for a single posi‐<br>
      tion in the blockchain.<br>
      The Genesis Block<br>
      The first block in the blockchain is called the genesis block and was
      created in 2009. It<br>
      is the common ancestor of all the blocks in the blockchain, meaning that
      if you start<br>
      at any block and follow the chain backward in time, you will eventually
      arrive at the<br>
      genesis block.<br>
      Every node always starts with a blockchain of at least one block because
      the genesis<br>
      block is statically encoded within the bitcoin client software, such that
      it cannot be<br>
      altered. Every node always “knows” the genesis block’s hash and structure,
      the fixed<br>
      time it was created, and even the single transaction within. Thus, every
      node has the<br>
      198<br>
      &nbsp;| Chapter 9: The Blockchain<br>
      starting point for the blockchain, a secure “root” from which to build a
      trusted block‐<br>

      input contains the text “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of
      second bail‐<br>
      out for banks.” This message was intended to offer proof of the earliest
      date this block<br>
      was created, by referencing the headline of the British newspaper The
      Times. It also<br>
      serves as a tongue-in-cheek reminder of the importance of an independent
      monetary<br>
      system, with bitcoin’s launch occurring at the same time as an
      unprecedented world‐<br>
      wide monetary crisis. The message was embedded in the first block by
      Satoshi Naka‐<br>
      moto, bitcoin’s creator.<br>

      Linking Blocks in the Blockchain<br>
      Bitcoin full nodes maintain a local copy of the blockchain, starting at
      the genesis<br>
      block. The local copy of the blockchain is constantly updated as new
      blocks are found<br>
      and used to extend the chain. As a node receives incoming blocks from the
      network,<br>
      it will validate these blocks and then link them to the existing
      blockchain. To establish<br>
      a link, a node will examine the incoming block header and look for the
      “previous<br>
      block hash.”<br>
      Let’s assume, for example, that a node has 277,314 blocks in the local
      copy of the<br>
      blockchain. The last block the node knows about is block 277,314, with a
      block<br>
      header hash of:<br>

      The bitcoin node then receives a new block from the network, which it

      Looking at this new block, the node finds the previousblockhash field,
      which con‐<br>
      tains the hash of its parent block. It is a hash known to the node, that
      of the last block<br>
      on the chain at height 277,314. Therefore, this new block is a child of
      the last block on<br>
      the chain and extends the existing blockchain. The node adds this new
      block to the<br>
      end of the chain, making the blockchain longer with a new height of
      277,315.<br>

      Merkle Trees<br>
      Each block in the bitcoin blockchain contains a summary of all the
      transactions in the<br>

      A merkle tree, also known as a binary hash tree, is a data structure used
      for efficiently<br>
      summarizing and verifying the integrity of large sets of data. Merkle
      trees are binary<br>
      trees containing cryptographic hashes. The term “tree” is used in computer

      Merkle Trees<br>
      |<br>
      201<br>
      Merkle trees are used in bitcoin to summarize all the transactions in a
      block, produc‐<br>
      ing an overall digital fingerprint of the entire set of transactions,
      providing a very effi‐<br>
      cient process to verify whether a transaction is included in a block. A
      merkle tree is<br>
      constructed by recursively hashing pairs of nodes until there is only one
      hash, called<br>
      the root, or merkle root. The cryptographic hash algorithm used in
      bitcoin’s merkle<br>
      trees is SHA256 applied twice, also known as double-SHA256.<br>
      When N data elements are hashed and summarized in a merkle tree, you can
      check to<br>
      see if any one data element is included in the tree with at most 2*log2(N)
      calcula‐<br>
      tions, making this a very efficient data structure.<br>
      The merkle tree is constructed bottom-up. In the following example, we
      start with<br>
      four transactions, A, B, C, and D, which form the leaves of the merkle
      tree, as shown<br>
      in Figure 9-2. The transactions are not stored in the merkle tree; rather,
      their data is<br>
      hashed and the resulting hash is stored in each leaf node as HA, HB, HC,
      and HD:<br>
      HA = SHA256(SHA256(Transaction A))<br>
      Consecutive pairs of leaf nodes are then summarized in a parent node, by
      concatenat‐<br>
      ing the two hashes and hashing them together. For example, to construct
      the parent<br>
      node H AB, the two 32-byte hashes of the children are concatenated to
      create a 64-byte<br>
      string. That string is then double-hashed to produce the parent node’s
      hash:<br>
      HAB = SHA256(SHA256(HA + HB))<br>
      The process continues until there is only one node at the top, the node
      known as the<br>
      merkle root. That 32-byte hash is stored in the block header and
      summarizes all the<br>
      data in all four transactions. Figure 9-2 shows how the root is calculated
      by pair-wise<br>
      hashes of the nodes.<br>
      Figure 9-2. Calculating the nodes in a merkle tree<br>
      202<br>
      &nbsp;| Chapter 9: The Blockchain<br>
      Because the merkle tree is a binary tree, it needs an even number of leaf
      nodes. If<br>
      there is an odd number of transactions to summarize, the last transaction
      hash will be<br>
      duplicated to create an even number of leaf nodes, also known as a
      balanced tree. This<br>
      is shown in Figure 9-3, where transaction C is duplicated.<br>
      Figure 9-3. Duplicating one data element achieves an even number of data
      elements<br>
      The same method for constructing a tree from four transactions can be
      generalized to<br>
      construct trees of any size. In bitcoin it is common to have several
      hundred to more<br>
      than a thousand transactions in a single block, which are summarized in
      exactly the<br>
      same way, producing just 32 bytes of data as the single merkle root. In
      Figure 9-4, you<br>
      will see a tree built from 16 transactions. Note that although the root
      looks bigger<br>
      than the leaf nodes in the diagram, it is the exact same size, just 32
      bytes. Whether<br>
      there is one transaction or a hundred thousand transactions in the block,
      the merkle<br>
      root always summarizes them into 32 bytes.<br>
      To prove that a specific transaction is included in a block, a node only
      needs to pro‐<br>
      duce log2(N) 32-byte hashes, constituting an authentication path or merkle
      path con‐<br>
      necting the specific transaction to the root of the tree. This is
      especially important as<br>
      the number of transactions increases, because the base-2 logarithm of the
      number of<br>
      transactions increases much more slowly. This allows bitcoin nodes to
      efficiently pro‐<br>
      duce paths of 10 or 12 hashes (320–384 bytes), which can provide proof of
      a single<br>
      transaction out of more than a thousand transactions in a megabyte-sized
      block.<br>

      Figure 9-4. A merkle tree summarizing many data elements<br>
      In Figure 9-5, a node can prove that a transaction K is included in the
      block by pro‐<br>
      ducing a merkle path that is only four 32-byte hashes long (128 bytes
      total). The path<br>
      consists of the four hashes (shown with a shaded background in Figure 9-5)
      HL, HIJ,<br>
      HMNOP, and HABCDEFGH. With those four hashes provided as an authentication
      path,<br>
      any node can prove that HK (with a black background at the bottom of the
      diagram)<br>
      is included in the merkle root by computing four additional pair-wise
      hashes HKL,<br>
      HIJKL, HIJKLMNOP, and the merkle tree root (outlined in a dashed line in
      the diagram).<br>

      &nbsp;Chapter 9: The Blockchain<br>
      required to prove the inclusion of a transaction increases much more
      slowly, from<br>
      128 bytes to only 512 bytes. With merkle trees, a node can download just
      the block<br>
      headers (80 bytes per block) and still be able to identify a transaction’s
      inclusion in a<br>
      block by retrieving a small merkle path from a full node, without storing
      or transmit‐<br>
      ting the vast majority of the blockchain, which might be several gigabytes
      in size.<br>
      Nodes that do not maintain a full blockchain, called simplified payment
      verification<br>
      (SPV) nodes, use merkle paths to verify transactions without downloading
      full<br>
      blocks.<br>
      Merkle Trees and Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)<br>
      Merkle trees are used extensively by SPV nodes. SPV nodes don’t have all
      transactions<br>
      and do not download full blocks, just block headers. In order to verify
      that a transac‐<br>
      tion is included in a block, without having to download all the
      transactions in the<br>
      block, they use an authentication path, or merkle path.<br>
      Consider, for example, an SPV node that is interested in incoming payments
      to an<br>
      address contained in its wallet. The SPV node will establish a bloom
      filter (see<br>
      “Bloom Filters” on page 185) on its connections to peers to limit the
      transactions<br>
      received to only those containing addresses of interest. When a peer sees
      a transac‐<br>
      tion that matches the bloom filter, it will send that block using a
      merkleblock mes‐<br>
      sage. The merkleblock message contains the block header as well as a
      merkle path<br>
      that links the transaction of interest to the merkle root in the block.
      The SPV node<br>
      can use this merkle path to connect the transaction to the block and
      verify that the<br>
      transaction is included in the block. The SPV node also uses the block
      header to link<br>
      the block to the rest of the blockchain. The combination of these two
      links, between<br>
      the transaction and block, and between the block and blockchain, proves
      that the<br>
      transaction is recorded in the blockchain. All in all, the SPV node will
      have received<br>
      less than a kilobyte of data for the block header and merkle path, an
      amount of data<br>
      that is more than a thousand times less than a full block (about 1
      megabyte cur‐<br>
      rently).<br>
      Bitcoin’s Test Blockchains<br>
      You might be surprised to learn that there is more than one bitcoin
      blockchain. The<br>
      “main” bitcoin blockchain, the one created by Satoshi Nakamoto on January
      3rd,<br>
      2009, the one with the genesis block we studied in this chapter, is called
      mainnet.<br>
      There are other bitcoin blockchains that are used for testing purposes: at
      this time<br>
      testnet, segnet, and regtest. Let’s look at each in turn.<br>
      Merkle Trees and Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;207<br>
      Testnet—Bitcoin’s Testing Playground<br>
      Testnet is the name of the test blockchain, network, and currency that is
      used for test‐<br>
      ing purposes. The testnet is a fully featured live P2P network, with
      wallets, test bit‐<br>
      coins (testnet coins), mining, and all the other features of mainnet.
      There are really<br>
      only two differences: testnet coins are meant to be worthless and mining
      difficulty<br>
      should be low enough that anyone can mine testnet coins relatively easily
      (keeping<br>
      them worthless).<br>
      Any software development that is intended for production use on bitcoin’s
      mainnet<br>
      should first be tested on testnet with test coins. This protects both the
      developers<br>
      from monetary losses due to bugs and the network from unintended behavior
      due to<br>
      bugs.<br>
      Keeping the coins worthless and the mining easy, however, is not easy.
      Despite pleas<br>
      from developers, some people use advanced mining equipment (GPUs and
      ASICs) to<br>
      mine on testnet. This increases the difficulty, makes it impossible to
      mine with a<br>
      CPU, and eventually makes it difficult enough to get test coins that
      people start valu‐<br>
      ing them, so they’re not worthless. As a result, every now and then, the
      testnet has to<br>
      be scrapped and restarted from a new genesis block, resetting the
      difficulty.<br>
      The current testnet is called testnet3, the third iteration of testnet,
      restarted in Febru‐<br>
      ary 2011 to reset the difficulty from the previous testnet.<br>
      Keep in mind that testnet3 is a large blockchain, in excess of 20 GB in
      early 2017. It<br>
      will take a day or so to sync fully and use up resources on your computer.
      Not as<br>
      much as mainnet, but not exactly “lightweight” either. One good way to run
      a testnet<br>
      node is as a virtual machine image (e.g., VirtualBox, Docker, Cloud
      Server, etc.) dedi‐<br>
      cated for that purpose.<br>
      Using testnet<br>
      Bitcoin Core, like almost all other bitcoin software, has full support for
      operation on<br>
      testnet instead of mainnet, but also allows you to mine testnet coins and
      operate a full<br>
      testnet node.<br>
      To start Bitcoin Core on testnet instead of mainnet you use the testnet
      switch:<br>
      $ bitcoind -testnet<br>
      In the logs you should see that bitcoind is building a new blockchain in
      the testnet3<br>
      subdirectory of the default bitcoind directory:<br>
      bitcoind: Using data directory /home/username/.bitcoin/testnet3<br>
      To connect to bitcoind, you use the bitcoin-cli command-line tool, but you
      must<br>
      also switch it to testnet mode:<br>

      to Segregated<br>
      Witness (see Appendix D), which has yet to activate on mainnet. Therefore,
      testnet3<br>
      can also be used to test Segregated Witness features.<br>

      &nbsp;209<br>
      Segnet—The Segregated Witness Testnet<br>
      In 2016, a special-purpose testnet was launched to aid in development and
      testing of<br>
      Segregated Witness (aka segwit; see Appendix D). This test blockchain is
      called seg<br>
      net and can be joined by running a special version (branch) of Bitcoin
      Core.<br>
      Since segwit was added to testnet3, it is no longer necessary to use
      segnet for testing<br>
      of segwit features.<br>
      In the future it is likely we will see other testnet blockchains that are
      specifically<br>
      designed to test a single feature or major architectural change, like
      segnet.<br>
      Regtest—The Local Blockchain<br>
      Regtest, which stands for “Regression Testing,” is a Bitcoin Core feature
      that allows<br>
      you to create a local blockchain for testing purposes. Unlike testnet3,
      which is a pub‐<br>
      lic and shared test blockchain, the regtest blockchains are intended to be
      run as<br>
      closed systems for local testing. You launch a regtest blockchain from

      ing a local genesis block. You may add other nodes to the network, or run
      it with a<br>
      single node only to test the Bitcoin Core software.<br>
      To start Bitcoin Core in regtest mode, you use the regtest flag:<br>
      $ bitcoind -regtest<br>
      Just like with testnet, Bitcoin Core will initialize a new blockchain

      subdirectory of your bitcoind default directory:<br>
      bitcoind: Using data directory /home/username/.bitcoin/regtest<br>
      To use the command-line tool, you need to specify the regtest flag too.
      Let’s try the<br>
      getblockchaininfo command to inspect the regtest blockchain:<br>
      $ bitcoin-cli -regtest getblockchaininfo<br>

      It will only take a few seconds to mine all these blocks, which certainly
      makes it easy<br>
      for testing. If you check your wallet balance, you will see that you
      earned reward for<br>
      the first 400 blocks (coinbase rewards must be 100 blocks deep before you
      can spend<br>

      Using Test Blockchains for Development<br>
      Bitcoin’s various blockchains (regtest, segnet, testnet3, mainnet) offer a
      range of<br>
      testing environments for bitcoin development. Use the test blockchains
      whether you<br>
      are developing for Bitcoin Core, or another full-node consensus client; an
      application<br>
      such as a wallet, exchange, ecommerce site; or even developing novel smart
      contracts<br>
      and complex scripts.<br>
      You can use the test blockchains to establish a development pipeline. Test
      your code<br>
      locally on a regtest as you develop it. Once you are ready to try it on a
      public net‐<br>
      work, switch to testnet to expose your code to a more dynamic environment
      with<br>
      more diversity of code and applications. Finally, once you are confident
      your code<br>
      works as expected, switch to mainnet to deploy it in production. As you
      make<br>
      changes, improvements, bug fixes, etc., start the pipeline again,
      deploying each<br>
      change first on regtest, then on testnet, and finally into production.<br>

      CHAPTER 10<br>
      Mining and Consensus<br>
      Introduction<br>
      The word “mining” is somewhat misleading. By evoking the extraction of
      precious<br>
      metals, it focuses our attention on the reward for mining, the new bitcoin
      created in<br>
      each block. Although mining is incentivized by this reward, the primary
      purpose of<br>
      mining is not the reward or the generation of new coins. If you view
      mining only as<br>
      the process by which coins are created, you are mistaking the means
      (incentives) as<br>
      the goal of the process. Mining is the mechanism that underpins the
      decentralized<br>
      clearinghouse, by which transactions are validated and cleared. Mining is
      the inven‐<br>
      tion that makes bitcoin special, a decentralized security mechanism that
      is the basis<br>
      for P2P digital cash.<br>
      Mining secures the bitcoin system and enables the emergence of
      network-wide consen‐<br>
      sus without a central authority. The reward of newly minted coins and
      transaction<br>
      fees is an incentive scheme that aligns the actions of miners with the
      security of the<br>
      network, while simultaneously implementing the monetary supply.<br>
      The purpose of mining is not the creation of new bitcoin. That’s the<br>
      incentive system. Mining is the mechanism by which bitcoin’s secu‐<br>
      rity is decentralized.<br>
      Miners validate new transactions and record them on the global ledger. A
      new block,<br>
      containing transactions that occurred since the last block, is “mined”
      every 10<br>
      minutes on average, thereby adding those transactions to the blockchain.
      Transac‐<br>
      tions that become part of a block and added to the blockchain are
      considered “con‐<br>
      213<br>
      firmed,” which allows the new owners of bitcoin to spend the bitcoin they
      received in<br>
      those transactions.<br>
      Miners receive two types of rewards in return for the security provided by
      mining:<br>
      new coins created with each new block, and transaction fees from all the
      transactions<br>
      included in the block. To earn this reward, miners compete to solve a
      difficult mathe‐<br>
      matical problem based on a cryptographic hash algorithm. The solution to
      the prob‐<br>
      lem, called the Proof-of-Work, is included in the new block and acts as
      proof that the<br>
      miner expended significant computing effort. The competition to solve the
      Proof-of-<br>
      Work algorithm to earn the reward and the right to record transactions on
      the block‐<br>
      chain is the basis for bitcoin’s security model.<br>
      The process is called mining because the reward (new coin generation) is
      designed to<br>
      simulate diminishing returns, just like mining for precious metals.
      Bitcoin’s money<br>
      supply is created through mining, similar to how a central bank issues new
      money by<br>
      printing bank notes. The maximum amount of newly created bitcoin a miner
      can add<br>
      to a block decreases approximately every four years (or precisely every
      210,000<br>
      blocks). It started at 50 bitcoin per block in January of 2009 and halved
      to 25 bitcoin<br>
      per block in November of 2012. It halved again to 12.5 bitcoin in July
      2016. Based on<br>
      this formula, bitcoin mining rewards decrease exponentially until
      approximately the<br>
      year 2140, when all bitcoin (20.99999998 million) will have been issued.
      After 2140,<br>
      no new bitcoin will be issued.<br>
      Bitcoin miners also earn fees from transactions. Every transaction may
      include a<br>
      transaction fee, in the form of a surplus of bitcoin between the
      transaction’s inputs<br>
      and outputs. The winning bitcoin miner gets to “keep the change” on the
      transactions<br>
      included in the winning block. Today, the fees represent 0.5% or less of a
      bitcoin min‐<br>
      er’s income, the vast majority coming from the newly minted bitcoin.
      However, as the<br>
      reward decreases over time and the number of transactions per block
      increases, a<br>
      greater proportion of bitcoin mining earnings will come from fees.
      Gradually, the<br>
      mining reward will be dominated by transaction fees, which will form the
      primary<br>
      incentive for miners. After 2140, the amount of new bitcoin in each block
      drops to<br>
      zero and bitcoin mining will be incentivized only by transaction fees.<br>
      In this chapter, we will first examine mining as a monetary supply
      mechanism and<br>
      then look at the most important function of mining: the decentralized
      consensus<br>
      mechanism that underpins bitcoin’s security.<br>
      To understand mining and consensus, we will follow Alice’s transaction as
      it is<br>
      received and added to a block by Jing’s mining equipment. Then we will
      follow the<br>
      block as it is mined, added to the blockchain, and accepted by the bitcoin
      network<br>
      through the process of emergent consensus.<br>
      214<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 10: Mining and Consensus<br>
      Bitcoin Economics and Currency Creation<br>
      Bitcoin are “minted” during the creation of each block at a fixed and
      diminishing<br>
      rate. Each block, generated on average every 10 minutes, contains entirely
      new bit‐<br>
      coin, created from nothing. Every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every
      four years,<br>
      the currency issuance rate is decreased by 50%. For the first four years
      of operation of<br>
      the network, each block contained 50 new bitcoin.<br>
      In November 2012, the new bitcoin issuance rate was decreased to 25
      bitcoin per<br>
      block. In July of 2016 it was decreased again to 12.5 bitcoin per block.
      It will halve<br>
      again to 6.25 bitcoin at block 630,000, which will be mined sometime in
      2020. The<br>
      rate of new coins decreases like this exponentially over 32 “halvings”
      until block<br>
      6,720,000 (mined approximately in year 2137), when it reaches the minimum
      cur‐<br>
      rency unit of 1 satoshi. Finally, after 6.93 million blocks, in
      approximately 2140,<br>
      almost 2,099,999,997,690,000 satoshis, or almost 21 million bitcoin, will
      be issued.<br>
      Thereafter, blocks will contain no new bitcoin, and miners will be
      rewarded solely<br>
      through the transaction fees. Figure 10-1 shows the total bitcoin in
      circulation over<br>
      time, as the issuance of currency decreases.<br>
      Figure 10-1. Supply of bitcoin currency over time based on a geometrically
      decreasing<br>
      issuance rate<br>
      The maximum number of coins mined is the upper limit of possible<br>
      mining rewards for bitcoin. In practice, a miner may intentionally<br>
      mine a block taking less than the full reward. Such blocks have<br>
      already been mined and more may be mined in the future, result‐<br>
      ing in a lower total issuance of the currency.<br>
      In the example code in Example 10-1, we calculate the total amount of
      bitcoin that<br>
      will be issued.<br>

      issued<br>
      # Original block reward for miners was 50 BTC<br>
      start_block_reward = 50<br>

      reward_interval = 210000<br>
      def max_money():<br>
      # 50 BTC = 50 0000 0000 Satoshis<br>

      while current_reward &gt; 0:<br>
      total += reward_interval * current_reward<br>
      current_reward /= 2<br>
      return total<br>

      $ python max_money.py<br>
      Total BTC to ever be created: 2099999997690000 Satoshis<br>
      The finite and diminishing issuance creates a fixed monetary supply that
      resists infla‐<br>
      tion. Unlike a fiat currency, which can be printed in infinite numbers by
      a central<br>
      bank, bitcoin can never be inflated by printing.<br>
      Deflationary Money<br>
      The most important and debated consequence of fixed and diminishing
      monetary<br>
      issuance is that the currency tends to be inherently deflationary.
      Deflation is the phe‐<br>
      nomenon of appreciation of value due to a mismatch in supply and demand
      that<br>
      drives up the value (and exchange rate) of a currency. The opposite of
      inflation, price<br>
      deflation, means that the money has more purchasing power over time.<br>
      Many economists argue that a deflationary economy is a disaster that
      should be avoi‐<br>
      ded at all costs. That is because in a period of rapid deflation, people
      tend to hoard<br>
      money instead of spending it, hoping that prices will fall. Such a
      phenomenon unfol‐<br>
      ded during Japan’s “Lost Decade,” when a complete collapse of demand
      pushed the<br>
      currency into a deflationary spiral.<br>
      Bitcoin experts argue that deflation is not bad per se. Rather, deflation
      is associated<br>
      with a collapse in demand because that is the only example of deflation we
      have to<br>
      study. In a fiat currency with the possibility of unlimited printing, it
      is very difficult to<br>
      enter a deflationary spiral unless there is a complete collapse in demand
      and an<br>
      216<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 10: Mining and Consensus<br>
      unwillingness to print money. Deflation in bitcoin is not caused by a
      collapse in<br>
      demand, but by a predictably constrained supply.<br>
      The positive aspect of deflation, of course, is that it is the opposite of
      inflation. Infla‐<br>
      tion causes a slow but inevitable debasement of currency, resulting in a
      form of hid‐<br>
      den taxation that punishes savers in order to bail out debtors (including
      the biggest<br>
      debtors, governments themselves). Currencies under government control
      suffer from<br>
      the moral hazard of easy debt issuance that can later be erased through
      debasement at<br>
      the expense of savers.<br>
      It remains to be seen whether the deflationary aspect of the currency is a
      problem<br>
      when it is not driven by rapid economic retraction, or an advantage
      because the pro‐<br>
      tection from inflation and debasement far outweighs the risks of
      deflation.<br>
      Decentralized Consensus<br>
      In the previous chapter we looked at the blockchain, the global public
      ledger (list) of<br>
      all transactions, which everyone in the bitcoin network accepts as the
      authoritative<br>
      record of ownership.<br>
      But how can everyone in the network agree on a single universal “truth”
      about who<br>
      owns what, without having to trust anyone? All traditional payment systems
      depend<br>
      on a trust model that has a central authority providing a clearinghouse
      service, basi‐<br>
      cally verifying and clearing all transactions. Bitcoin has no central
      authority, yet<br>
      somehow every full node has a complete copy of a public ledger that it can
      trust as<br>
      the authoritative record. The blockchain is not created by a central
      authority, but is<br>
      assembled independently by every node in the network. Somehow, every node
      in the<br>
      network, acting on information transmitted across insecure network
      connections,<br>
      can arrive at the same conclusion and assemble a copy of the same public
      ledger as<br>
      everyone else. This chapter examines the process by which the bitcoin
      network ach‐<br>
      ieves global consensus without central authority.<br>
      Satoshi Nakamoto’s main invention is the decentralized mechanism for
      emergent con‐<br>
      sensus. Emergent, because consensus is not achieved explicitly—there is no
      election<br>
      or fixed moment when consensus occurs. Instead, consensus is an emergent
      artifact<br>
      of the asynchronous interaction of thousands of independent nodes, all
      following<br>
      simple rules. All the properties of bitcoin, including currency,
      transactions, payments,<br>
      and the security model that does not depend on central authority or trust,
      derive<br>
      from this invention.<br>
      Bitcoin’s decentralized consensus emerges from the interplay of four
      processes that<br>
      occur independently on nodes across the network:<br>
      Decentralized Consensus<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;217<br>
      • Independent verification of each transaction, by every full node, based
      on a com‐<br>
      prehensive list of criteria<br>
      • Independent aggregation of those transactions into new blocks by mining
      nodes,<br>
      coupled with demonstrated computation through a Proof-of-Work algorithm<br>
      • Independent verification of the new blocks by every node and assembly
      into a<br>
      chain<br>
      • Independent selection, by every node, of the chain with the most
      cumulative<br>
      computation demonstrated through Proof-of-Work<br>
      In the next few sections we will examine these processes and how they
      interact to cre‐<br>
      ate the emergent property of network-wide consensus that allows any
      bitcoin node to<br>
      assemble its own copy of the authoritative, trusted, public, global
      ledger.<br>
      Independent Verification of Transactions<br>
      In Chapter 6, we saw how wallet software creates transactions by
      collecting UTXO,<br>
      providing the appropriate unlocking scripts, and then constructing new
      outputs<br>
      assigned to a new owner. The resulting transaction is then sent to the
      neighboring<br>
      nodes in the bitcoin network so that it can be propagated across the
      entire bitcoin<br>
      network.<br>
      However, before forwarding transactions to its neighbors, every bitcoin
      node that<br>
      receives a transaction will first verify the transaction. This ensures
      that only valid<br>
      transactions are propagated across the network, while invalid transactions
      are dis‐<br>
      carded at the first node that encounters them.<br>
      Each node verifies every transaction against a long checklist of criteria:<br>
      • The transaction’s syntax and data structure must be correct.<br>
      • Neither lists of inputs or outputs are empty.<br>
      • The transaction size in bytes is less than MAX_BLOCK_SIZE.<br>
      • Each output value, as well as the total, must be within the allowed
      range of values<br>
      (less than 21m coins, more than the dust threshold).<br>
      • None of the inputs have hash=0, N=–1 (coinbase transactions should not
      be<br>
      relayed).<br>
      • nLocktime is equal to INT_MAX, or nLocktime and nSequence values are
      satisfied<br>
      according to MedianTimePast.<br>
      • The transaction size in bytes is greater than or equal to 100.<br>
      • The number of signature operations (SIGOPS) contained in the transaction
      is<br>
      less than the signature operation limit.<br>
      218<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 10: Mining and Consensus<br>
      • The unlocking script (scriptSig) can only push numbers on the stack, and
      the<br>
      locking script (scriptPubkey) must match isStandard forms (this rejects
      “non‐<br>
      standard” transactions).<br>
      • A matching transaction in the pool, or in a block in the main branch,
      must exist.<br>
      • For each input, if the referenced output exists in any other transaction
      in the<br>
      pool, the transaction must be rejected.<br>
      • For each input, look in the main branch and the transaction pool to find
      the ref‐<br>
      erenced output transaction. If the output transaction is missing for any
      input,<br>
      this will be an orphan transaction. Add to the orphan transactions pool,
      if a<br>
      matching transaction is not already in the pool.<br>
      • For each input, if the referenced output transaction is a coinbase
      output, it must<br>
      have at least COINBASE_MATURITY (100) confirmations.<br>
      • For each input, the referenced output must exist and cannot already be
      spent.<br>
      • Using the referenced output transactions to get input values, check that
      each<br>
      input value, as well as the sum, are in the allowed range of values (less
      than 21m<br>
      coins, more than 0).<br>
      • Reject if the sum of input values is less than sum of output values.<br>
      • Reject if transaction fee would be too low (minRelayTxFee) to get into
      an empty<br>
      block.<br>
      • The unlocking scripts for each input must validate against the
      corresponding<br>
      output locking scripts.<br>
      These conditions can be seen in detail in the functions
      AcceptToMemoryPool, Check<br>
      Transaction, and CheckInputs in Bitcoin Core. Note that the conditions
      change over<br>
      time, to address new types of denial-of-service attacks or sometimes to
      relax the rules<br>
      so as to include more types of transactions.<br>
      By independently verifying each transaction as it is received and before
      propagating<br>
      it, every node builds a pool of valid (but unconfirmed) transactions known
      as the<br>
      transaction pool, memory pool, or mempool.<br>
      Mining Nodes<br>
      Some of the nodes on the bitcoin network are specialized nodes called
      miners. In<br>
      Chapter 1 we introduced Jing, a computer engineering student in Shanghai,
      China,<br>
      who is a bitcoin miner. Jing earns bitcoin by running a “mining rig,”
      which is a speci‐<br>
      alized computer-hardware system designed to mine bitcoin. Jing’s
      specialized mining<br>
      hardware is connected to a server running a full bitcoin node. Unlike
      Jing, some min‐<br>
      ers mine without a full node, as we will see in “Mining Pools” on page
      250. Like every<br>
      other full node, Jing’s node receives and propagates unconfirmed
      transactions on the<br>
      Mining Nodes<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;219<br>
      bitcoin network. Jing’s node, however, also aggregates these transactions
      into new<br>
      blocks.<br>
      Jing’s node is listening for new blocks, propagated on the bitcoin
      network, as do all<br>
      nodes. However, the arrival of a new block has special significance for a
      mining node.<br>
      The competition among miners effectively ends with the propagation of a
      new block<br>
      that acts as an announcement of a winner. To miners, receiving a valid new
      block<br>
      means someone else won the competition and they lost. However, the end of
      one<br>
      round of a competition is also the beginning of the next round. The new
      block is not<br>
      just a checkered flag, marking the end of the race; it is also the
      starting pistol in the<br>
      race for the next block.<br>
      Aggregating Transactions into Blocks<br>
      After validating transactions, a bitcoin node will add them to the memory
      pool, or<br>
      transaction pool, where transactions await until they can be included
      (mined) into a<br>
      block. Jing’s node collects, validates, and relays new transactions just
      like any other<br>
      node. Unlike other nodes, however, Jing’s node will then aggregate these
      transactions<br>
      into a candidate block.<br>
      Let’s follow the blocks that were created during the time Alice bought a
      cup of coffee<br>
      from Bob’s Cafe (see “Buying a Cup of Coffee” on page 16). Alice’s
      transaction was<br>
      included in block 277,316. For the purpose of demonstrating the concepts
      in this<br>
      chapter, let’s assume that block was mined by Jing’s mining system and
      follows Alice’s<br>
      transaction as it becomes part of this new block.<br>
      Jing’s mining node maintains a local copy of the blockchain. By the time
      Alice buys<br>
      the cup of coffee, Jing’s node has assembled a chain up to block 277,314.
      Jing’s node is<br>
      listening for transactions, trying to mine a new block and also listening
      for blocks<br>
      discovered by other nodes. As Jing’s node is mining, it receives block
      277,315 through<br>
      the bitcoin network. The arrival of this block signifies the end of the
      competition for<br>
      block 277,315 and the beginning of the competition to create block
      277,316.<br>
      During the previous 10 minutes, while Jing’s node was searching for a
      solution to<br>
      block 277,315, it was also collecting transactions in preparation for the
      next block. By<br>
      now it has collected a few hundred transactions in the memory pool. Upon
      receiving<br>
      block 277,315 and validating it, Jing’s node will also compare it against
      all the transac‐<br>
      tions in the memory pool and remove any that were included in block
      277,315.<br>
      Whatever transactions remain in the memory pool are unconfirmed and are
      waiting<br>
      to be recorded in a new block.<br>
      Jing’s node immediately constructs a new empty block, a candidate for
      block 277,316.<br>
      This block is called a candidate block because it is not yet a valid
      block, as it does not<br>
      contain a valid Proof-of-Work. The block becomes valid only if the miner
      succeeds in<br>
      finding a solution to the Proof-of-Work algorithm.<br>
      220<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 10: Mining and Consensus<br>
      When Jing’s node aggregates all the transactions from the memory pool, the
      new can‐<br>
      didate block has 418 transactions with total transaction fees of
      0.09094928 bitcoin.<br>
      You can see this block in the blockchain using the Bitcoin Core client

      The Coinbase Transaction<br>
      The first transaction in any block is a special transaction, called a
      coinbase transac‐<br>
      tion. This transaction is constructed by Jing’s node and contains his
      reward for the<br>
      mining effort.<br>
      When block 277,316 was mined, the reward was 25 bitcoin per<br>
      block. Since then, one “halving” period has elapsed. The block<br>
      reward changed to 12.5 bitcoin in July 2016. It will be halved again<br>
      in 210,000 blocks, in the year 2020.<br>
      Aggregating Transactions into Blocks<br>

      more efficient than multiple repeated divisions. To avoid a potential bug,
      the shift<br>
      operation is skipped after 63 halvings, and the subsidy is set to 0.<br>
      Finally, the coinbase reward (nSubsidy) is added to the transaction fees
      (nFees), and<br>
      the sum is returned.<br>
      If Jing’s mining node writes the coinbase transaction, what stops<br>
      Jing from “rewarding” himself 100 or 1000 bitcoin? The answer is<br>
      that an incorrect reward would result in the block being deemed<br>
      invalid by everyone else, wasting Jing’s electricity used for Proof-of-<br>
      Work. Jing only gets to spend the reward if the block is accepted by<br>
      everyone.<br>
      Structure of the Coinbase Transaction<br>
      With these calculations, Jing’s node then constructs the coinbase
      transaction to pay<br>
      himself 25.09094928 bitcoin.<br>
      As you can see in Example 10-4, the coinbase transaction has a special
      format.<br>
      Instead of a transaction input specifying a previous UTXO to spend, it has
      a “coin‐<br>
      base” input. We examined transaction inputs in Table 6-2. Let’s compare a
      regular<br>
      transaction input with a coinbase transaction input. Table 10-1 shows the
      structure of<br>
      a regular transaction, while Table 10-2 shows the structure of the
      coinbase transac‐<br>

      In a coinbase transaction, the first two fields are set to values that do
      not represent a<br>
      UTXO reference. Instead of a “transaction hash,” the first field is filled
      with 32 bytes<br>
      all set to zero. The “output index” is filled with 4 bytes all set to 0xFF
      (255 decimal).<br>
      The “Unlocking Script” (scriptSig) is replaced by coinbase data, a data
      field used by<br>
      the miners, as we will see next.<br>
      Coinbase Data<br>
      Coinbase transactions do not have an unlocking script (aka, scriptSig)
      field.<br>
      Instead, this field is replaced by coinbase data, which must be between 2
      and 100<br>
      bytes. Except for the first few bytes, the rest of the coinbase data can
      be used by min‐<br>
      ers in any way they want; it is arbitrary data.<br>
      In the genesis block, for example, Satoshi Nakamoto added the text “The
      Times<br>
      03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks” in the
      coinbase data,<br>
      using it as a proof of the date and to convey a message. Currently, miners
      use the<br>
      coinbase data to include extra nonce values and strings identifying the
      mining pool.<br>
      The first few bytes of the coinbase used to be arbitrary, but that is no
      longer the case.<br>
      As per BIP-34, version-2 blocks (blocks with the version field set to 2)
      must contain<br>
      the block height index as a script “push” operation in the beginning of
      the coinbase<br>
      field.<br>
      In block 277,316 we see that the coinbase (see Example 10-4), which is in
      the unlock‐<br>
      ing script or scriptSig field of the transaction input, contains the
      hexadecimal value<br>
      03443b0403858402062f503253482f. Let’s decode this value.<br>
      The first byte, 03, instructs the script execution engine to push the next
      three bytes<br>
      onto the script stack (see Table B-1). The next three bytes, 0x443b04, are
      the block<br>
      height encoded in little-endian format (backward, least-significant byte
      first). Reverse<br>
      the order of the bytes and the result is 0x043b44, which is 277,316 in
      decimal.<br>
      The next few hexadecimal digits (0385840206) are used to encode an extra
      nonce (see<br>
      “The Extra Nonce Solution” on page 249), or random value, used to find a
      suitable<br>
      Proof-of-Work solution.<br>
      The final part of the coinbase data (2f503253482f) is the ASCII-encoded<br>
      string /P2SH/, which indicates that the mining node that mined this block
      supports<br>
      the P2SH improvement defined in BIP-16. The introduction of the P2SH
      capability<br>
      required signaling by miners to endorse either BIP-16 or BIP-17. Those
      endorsing the<br>
      BIP-16 implementation were to include /P2SH/ in their coinbase data. Those
      endors‐<br>
      ing the BIP-17 implementation of P2SH were to include the string p2sh/CHV
      in their<br>
      coinbase data. The BIP-16 was elected as the winner, and many miners
      continued<br>
      including the string /P2SH/ in their coinbase to indicate support for this
      feature.<br>

      and Toolkits” on page 51 to extract the coinbase data from the genesis
      block, display‐<br>

      Constructing the Block Header<br>
      To construct the block header, the mining node needs to fill in six
      fields, as listed in<br>
      Table 10-3.<br>
      Table 10-3. The structure of the block header<br>
      Size<br>
      &nbsp;Field<br>
      &nbsp;Description<br>
      4 bytes<br>

      &nbsp;A version number to track software/protocol upgrades<br>

      4 bytes<br>
      &nbsp;Nonce<br>
      &nbsp;A counter used for the Proof-of-Work algorithm<br>
      At the time that block 277,316 was mined, the version number describing
      the block<br>
      structure is version 2, which is encoded in little-endian format in 4
      bytes as<br>
      0x02000000.<br>
      Next, the mining node needs to add the “Previous Block Hash” (also known
      as pre<br>
      vhash). That is the hash of the block header of block 277,315, the
      previous block<br>
      received from the network, which Jing’s node has accepted and selected as
      the parent<br>
      of the candidate block 277,316. The block header hash for block 277,315
      is:<br>
      0000000000000002a7bbd25a417c0374cc55261021e8a9ca74442b01284f0569<br>
      By selecting the specific parent block, indicated by the Previous<br>
      Block Hash field in the candidate block header, Jing is committing<br>
      his mining power to extending the chain that ends in that specific<br>
      block. In essence, this is how Jing “votes” with his mining power<br>
      for the longest-difficulty valid chain.<br>
      The next step is to summarize all the transactions with a merkle tree, in
      order to add<br>
      the merkle root to the block header. The coinbase transaction is listed as
      the first<br>
      transaction in the block. Then, 418 more transactions are added after it,
      for a total of<br>
      419 transactions in the block. As we saw in the “Merkle Trees” on page
      201, there<br>
      must be an even number of “leaf ” nodes in the tree, so the last
      transaction is duplica‐<br>
      ted, creating 420 nodes, each containing the hash of one transaction. The
      transaction<br>
      hashes are then combined, in pairs, creating each level of the tree, until
      all the trans‐<br>
      actions are summarized into one node at the “root” of the tree. The root
      of the merkle<br>
      tree summarizes all the transactions into a single 32-byte value, which
      you can see<br>
      listed as “merkle root” in Example 10-3, and here:<br>
      c91c008c26e50763e9f548bb8b2fc323735f73577effbc55502c51eb4cc7cf2e<br>

      &nbsp;|<br>

      Jing’s mining node will then add a 4-byte timestamp, encoded as a Unix
      “epoch” time‐<br>
      stamp, which is based on the number of seconds elapsed from January 1,
      1970, mid‐<br>
      night UTC/GMT. The time 1388185914 is equal to Friday, 27 Dec 2013,
      23:11:54<br>
      UTC/GMT.<br>
      Jing’s node then fills in the target, which defines the required
      Proof-of-Work to make<br>
      this a valid block. The target is stored in the block as a “target bits”
      metric, which is a<br>
      mantissa-exponent encoding of the target. The encoding has a 1-byte
      exponent, fol‐<br>
      lowed by a 3-byte mantissa (coefficient). In block 277,316, for example,
      the target bits<br>
      value is 0x1903a30c. The first part 0x19 is a hexadecimal exponent, while
      the next<br>
      part, 0x03a30c, is the coefficient. The concept of a target is explained
      in “Retargeting<br>
      to Adjust Difficulty” on page 235 and the “target bits” representation is
      explained in<br>
      “Target Representation” on page 235.<br>
      The final field is the nonce, which is initialized to zero.<br>
      With all the other fields filled, the block header is now complete and the
      process of<br>
      mining can begin. The goal is now to find a value for the nonce that
      results in a block<br>
      header hash that is less than the target. The mining node will need to
      test billions or<br>
      trillions of nonce values before a nonce is found that satisfies the
      requirement.<br>
      Mining the Block<br>
      Now that a candidate block has been constructed by Jing’s node, it is time
      for Jing’s<br>
      hardware mining rig to “mine” the block, to find a solution to the
      Proof-of-Work<br>
      algorithm that makes the block valid. Throughout this book we have studied
      crypto‐<br>
      graphic hash functions as used in various aspects of the bitcoin system.
      The hash<br>
      function SHA256 is the function used in bitcoin’s mining process.<br>
      In the simplest terms, mining is the process of hashing the block header
      repeatedly,<br>
      changing one parameter, until the resulting hash matches a specific
      target. The hash<br>
      function’s result cannot be determined in advance, nor can a pattern be
      created that<br>
      will produce a specific hash value. This feature of hash functions means
      that the only<br>
      way to produce a hash result matching a specific target is to try again
      and again, ran‐<br>
      domly modifying the input until the desired hash result appears by chance.<br>
      Proof-of-Work Algorithm<br>
      A hash algorithm takes an arbitrary-length data input and produces a
      fixed-length<br>
      deterministic result, a digital fingerprint of the input. For any specific
      input, the<br>
      resulting hash will always be the same and can be easily calculated and
      verified by<br>
      anyone implementing the same hash algorithm. The key characteristic of a
      crypto‐<br>
      graphic hash algorithm is that it is computationally infeasible to find
      two different<br>
      inputs that produce the same fingerprint (known as a collision). As a
      corollary, it is<br>
      228<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 10: Mining and Consensus<br>
      also virtually impossible to select an input in such a way as to produce a
      desired fin‐<br>
      gerprint, other than trying random inputs.<br>
      With SHA256, the output is always 256 bits long, regardless of the size of
      the input. In<br>
      Example 10-8, we will use the Python interpreter to calculate the SHA256
      hash of the<br>
      phrase, “I am Satoshi Nakamoto.”<br>
      Example 10-8. SHA256 example<br>
      $ python<br>
      Python 2.7.1<br>
      &gt;&gt;&gt; import hashlib<br>
      &gt;&gt;&gt; print hashlib.sha256("I am Satoshi Nakamoto").hexdigest()<br>
      5d7c7ba21cbbcd75d14800b100252d5b428e5b1213d27c385bc141ca6b47989e<br>
      Example 10-8 shows the result of calculating the hash of "I am Satoshi
      Nakamoto":<br>
      5d7c7ba21cbbcd75d14800b100252d5b428e5b1213d27c385bc141ca6b47989e.<br>
      &nbsp;This<br>
      256-bit number is the hash or digest of the phrase and depends on every
      part of the<br>
      phrase. Adding a single letter, punctuation mark, or any other character
      will produce<br>
      a different hash.<br>
      Now, if we change the phrase, we should expect to see completely different
      hashes.<br>
      Let’s try that by adding a number to the end of our phrase, using the
      simple Python<br>
      scripting in Example 10-9.<br>
      Example 10-9. SHA256 script for generating many hashes by iterating on a
      nonce<br>
      # example of iterating a nonce in a hashing algorithm's input<br>
      import hashlib<br>
      text = "I am Satoshi Nakamoto"<br>
      # iterate nonce from 0 to 19<br>
      for nonce in xrange(20):<br>
      # add the nonce to the end of the text<br>
      input = text + str(nonce)<br>
      # calculate the SHA-256 hash of the input (text+nonce)<br>
      hash = hashlib.sha256(input).hexdigest()<br>
      # show the input and hash result<br>
      print input, '=&gt;', hash<br>
      Running this will produce the hashes of several phrases, made different by
      adding a<br>
      number at the end of the text. By incrementing the number, we can get
      different<br>
      hashes, as shown in Example 10-10.<br>

      Each phrase produces a completely different hash result. They seem
      completely ran‐<br>
      dom, but you can reproduce the exact results in this example on any
      computer with<br>
      Python and see the same exact hashes.<br>
      The number used as a variable in such a scenario is called a nonce. The
      nonce is used<br>
      to vary the output of a cryptographic function, in this case to vary the
      SHA256 fin‐<br>
      gerprint of the phrase.<br>
      To make a challenge out of this algorithm, let’s set a target: find a
      phrase that pro‐<br>
      duces a hexadecimal hash that starts with a zero. Fortunately, this isn’t
      difficult!<br>
      Example 10-10 shows that the phrase “I am Satoshi Nakamoto13” produces the
      hash<br>
      0ebc56d59a34f5082aaef3d66b37a661696c2b618e62432727216ba9531041a5, which<br>
      fits our criteria. It took 13 attempts to find it. In terms of
      probabilities, if the output of<br>
      the hash function is evenly distributed we would expect to find a result
      with a 0 as the<br>
      hexadecimal prefix once every 16 hashes (one out of 16 hexadecimal digits
      0 through<br>
      F). In numerical terms, that means finding a hash value that is less than<br>
      0x1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000. We<br>
      call this threshold the target and the goal is to find a hash that is
      numerically less than<br>
      the target. If we decrease the target, the task of finding a hash that is
      less than the<br>
      target becomes more and more difficult.<br>
      To give a simple analogy, imagine a game where players throw a pair of
      dice repeat‐<br>
      edly, trying to throw less than a specified target. In the first round,
      the target is 12.<br>
      230<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 10: Mining and Consensus<br>
      Unless you throw double-six, you win. In the next round the target is 11.
      Players<br>
      must throw 10 or less to win, again an easy task. Let’s say a few rounds
      later the target<br>
      is down to 5. Now, more than half the dice throws will exceed the target
      and therefore<br>
      be invalid. It takes exponentially more dice throws to win, the lower the
      target gets.<br>
      Eventually, when the target is 2 (the minimum possible), only one throw
      out of every<br>
      36, or 2% of them, will produce a winning result.<br>
      From the perspective of an observer who knows that the target of the dice
      game is 2,<br>
      if someone has succeeded in casting a winning throw it can be assumed that
      they<br>
      attempted, on average, 36 throws. In other words, one can estimate the
      amount of<br>
      work it takes to succeed from the difficulty imposed by the target. When
      the algo‐<br>
      rithm is a based on a deterministic function such as SHA256, the input
      itself consti‐<br>
      tutes proof that a certain amount of work was done to produce a result
      below the<br>
      target. Hence, Proof-of-Work.<br>
      Even though each attempt produces a random outcome, the proba‐<br>
      bility of any possible outcome can be calculated in advance. There‐<br>
      fore, an outcome of specified difficulty constitutes proof of a<br>
      specific amount of work.<br>
      In Example 10-10, the winning “nonce” is 13 and this result can be
      confirmed by any‐<br>
      one independently. Anyone can add the number 13 as a suffix to the phrase
      “I am<br>
      Satoshi Nakamoto” and compute the hash, verifying that it is less than the
      target. The<br>
      successful result is also Proof-of-Work, because it proves we did the work
      to find that<br>
      nonce. While it only takes one hash computation to verify, it took us 13
      hash compu‐<br>
      tations to find a nonce that worked. If we had a lower target (higher
      difficulty) it<br>
      would take many more hash computations to find a suitable nonce, but only
      one hash<br>
      computation for anyone to verify. Furthermore, by knowing the target,
      anyone can<br>
      estimate the difficulty using statistics and therefore know how much work
      was<br>
      needed to find such a nonce.<br>
      The Proof-of-Work must produce a hash that is less than the target.<br>
      A higher target means it is less difficult to find a hash that is below<br>
      the target. A lower target means it is more difficult to find a hash<br>
      below the target. The target and difficulty are inversely related.<br>
      Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work is very similar to the challenge shown in Example
      10-10. The<br>
      miner constructs a candidate block filled with transactions. Next, the
      miner calculates<br>
      the hash of this block’s header and sees if it is smaller than the current
      target. If the<br>
      hash is not less than the target, the miner will modify the nonce (usually
      just incre‐<br>
      menting it by one) and try again. At the current difficulty in the bitcoin
      network,<br>
      Mining the Block<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;231<br>
      miners have to try quadrillions of times before finding a nonce that
      results in a low<br>
      enough block header hash.<br>
      A very simplified Proof-of-Work algorithm is implemented in Python in<br>

      solution. In<br>

      As you can see, increasing the difficulty by 1 bit causes a doubling in
      the time it takes<br>
      to find a solution. If you think of the entire 256-bit number space, each
      time you con‐<br>
      strain one more bit to zero, you decrease the search space by half. In
      Example 10-12,<br>
      it takes 84 million hash attempts to find a nonce that produces a hash
      with 26 leading<br>
      bits as zero. Even at a speed of more than 120,000 hashes per second, it
      still requires<br>
      10 minutes on a laptop to find this solution.<br>
      At the time of writing, the network is attempting to find a block whose
      header hash is<br>
      less than:<br>
      0000000000000000029AB9000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br>
      As you can see, there are a lot of zeros at the beginning of that target,
      meaning that<br>
      the acceptable range of hashes is much smaller, hence it’s more difficult
      to find a valid<br>
      hash. It will take on average more than 1.8 septa-hashes (thousand billion
      billion<br>
      hashes) per second for the network to discover the next block. That seems
      like an<br>
      impossible task, but fortunately the network is bringing 3 exa-hashes per
      second (EH/<br>
      sec) of processing power to bear, which will be able to find a block in
      about 10<br>
      minutes on average.<br>

      &nbsp;Chapter 10: Mining and Consensus<br>
      Target Representation<br>
      In Example 10-3, we saw that the block contains the target, in a notation
      called “target<br>
      bits” or just “bits,” which in block 277,316 has the value of 0x1903a30c.
      This notation<br>
      expresses the Proof-of-Work target as a coefficient/exponent format, with
      the first<br>
      two hexadecimal digits for the exponent and the next six hex digits as the
      coefficient.<br>
      In this block, therefore, the exponent is 0x19 and the coefficient is
      0x03a30c.<br>
      The formula to calculate the difficulty target from this representation
      is:<br>
      target = coefficient * 2^(8 * (exponent – 3))<br>
      Using that formula, and the difficulty bits value 0x1903a30c, we get:<br>
      target = 0x03a30c * 2^(0x08 * (0x19 - 0x03))^<br>
      =&gt; target = 0x03a30c * 2^(0x08 * 0x16)^<br>
      =&gt; target = 0x03a30c * 2^0xB0^<br>
      which in decimal is:<br>
      =&gt; target = 238,348 * 2^176^<br>
      =&gt; target =<br>
22,829,202,948,393,929,850,749,706,076,701,368,331,072,452,018,388,575,715,328<br>
      switching back to hexadecimal:<br>
      =&gt; target =
      0x0000000000000003A30C00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br>
      This means that a valid block for height 277,316 is one that has a block
      header hash<br>
      that is less than the target. In binary that number must have more than 60
      leading bits<br>
      set to zero. With this level of difficulty, a single miner processing 1
      trillion hashes per<br>
      second (1 terahash per second or 1 TH/sec) would only find a solution once
      every<br>
      8,496 blocks or once every 59 days, on average.<br>
      Retargeting to Adjust Difficulty<br>
      As we saw, the target determines the difficulty and therefore affects how
      long it takes<br>
      to find a solution to the Proof-of-Work algorithm. This leads to the
      obvious ques‐<br>
      tions: Why is the difficulty adjustable, who adjusts it, and how?<br>
      Bitcoin’s blocks are generated every 10 minutes, on average. This is
      bitcoin’s heartbeat<br>
      and underpins the frequency of currency issuance and the speed of
      transaction settle‐<br>
      ment. It has to remain constant not just over the short term, but over a
      period of<br>
      many decades. Over this time, it is expected that computer power will
      continue to<br>
      increase at a rapid pace. Furthermore, the number of participants in
      mining and the<br>
      computers they use will also constantly change. To keep the block
      generation time at<br>
      10 minutes, the difficulty of mining must be adjusted to account for these
      changes. In<br>
      Mining the Block<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;235<br>
      fact, the Proof-of-Work target is a dynamic parameter that is periodically
      adjusted to<br>
      meet a 10-minute block interval goal. In simple terms, the target is set
      so that the cur‐<br>
      rent mining power will result in a 10-minute block interval.<br>
      How, then, is such an adjustment made in a completely decentralized
      network? Retar‐<br>
      geting occurs automatically and on every node independently. Every 2,016
      blocks, all<br>
      nodes retarget the Proof-of-Work. The equation for retargeting measures
      the time it<br>
      took to find the last 2,016 blocks and compares that to the expected time
      of 20,160<br>
      minutes (2,016 blocks times the desired 10-minute block interval). The
      ratio between<br>
      the actual timespan and desired timespan is calculated and a proportionate
      adjust‐<br>
      ment (up or down) is made to the target. In simple terms: If the network
      is finding<br>
      blocks faster than every 10 minutes, the difficulty increases (target
      decreases). If block<br>
      discovery is slower than expected, the difficulty decreases (target
      increases).<br>
      The equation can be summarized as:<br>
      New Target = Old Target * (Actual Time of Last 2016 Blocks / 20160
      minutes)<br>
      Example 10-13 shows the code used in the Bitcoin Core client.<br>
      Example 10-13. Retargeting the Proof-of-Work—CalculateNextWorkRequired()
      in<br>
      pow.cpp<br>
      // Limit adjustment step<br>
      int64_t nActualTimespan = pindexLast-&gt;GetBlockTime() - nFirstBlockTime;<br>
      LogPrintf(" nActualTimespan = %d before bounds\n", nActualTimespan);<br>
      if (nActualTimespan &lt; params.nPowTargetTimespan/4)<br>
      nActualTimespan = params.nPowTargetTimespan/4;<br>
      if (nActualTimespan &gt; params.nPowTargetTimespan*4)<br>
      nActualTimespan = params.nPowTargetTimespan*4;<br>
      // Retarget<br>
      const arith_uint256 bnPowLimit = UintToArith256(params.powLimit);<br>
      arith_uint256 bnNew;<br>
      arith_uint256 bnOld;<br>
      bnNew.SetCompact(pindexLast-&gt;nBits);<br>
      bnOld = bnNew;<br>
      bnNew *= nActualTimespan;<br>
      bnNew /= params.nPowTargetTimespan;<br>
      if (bnNew &gt; bnPowLimit)<br>
      bnNew = bnPowLimit;<br>
      While the target calibration happens every 2,016 blocks, because of<br>
      an off-by-one error in the original Bitcoin Core client it is based on<br>
      the total time of the previous 2,015 blocks (not 2,016 as it should<br>
      be), resulting in a retargeting bias toward higher difficulty by<br>
      0.05%.<br>
      236<br>
      &nbsp;| Chapter 10: Mining and Consensus<br>
      The parameters Interval (2,016 blocks) and TargetTimespan (two weeks as<br>
      1,209,600 seconds) are defined in chainparams.cpp.<br>
      To avoid extreme volatility in the difficulty, the retargeting adjustment
      must be less<br>
      than a factor of four (4) per cycle. If the required target adjustment is
      greater than a<br>
      factor of four, it will be adjusted by a factor of 4 and not more. Any
      further adjust‐<br>
      ment will be accomplished in the next retargeting period because the
      imbalance will<br>
      persist through the next 2,016 blocks. Therefore, large discrepancies
      between hashing<br>
      power and difficulty might take several 2,016 block cycles to balance out.<br>
      The difficulty of mining a bitcoin block is approximately 10<br>
      minutes of processing for the entire network, based on the time it<br>
      took to mine the previous 2,016 blocks, adjusted every 2,016<br>
      blocks. This is achieved by lowering or raising the target.<br>
      Note that the target is independent of the number of transactions or the
      value of<br>
      transactions. This means that the amount of hashing power and therefore
      electricity<br>
      expended to secure bitcoin is also entirely independent of the number of
      transactions.<br>
      Bitcoin can scale up, achieve broader adoption, and remain secure without
      any<br>
      increase in hashing power from today’s level. The increase in hashing
      power repre‐<br>
      sents market forces as new miners enter the market to compete for the
      reward. As<br>
      long as enough hashing power is under the control of miners acting
      honestly in pur‐<br>
      suit of the reward, it is enough to prevent “takeover” attacks and,
      therefore, it is<br>
      enough to secure bitcoin.<br>
      The difficulty of mining is closely related to the cost of electricity and
      the exchange<br>
      rate of bitcoin vis-a-vis the currency used to pay for electricity.
      High-performance<br>
      mining systems are about as efficient as possible with the current
      generation of sili‐<br>
      con fabrication, converting electricity into hashing computation at the
      highest rate<br>
      possible. The primary influence on the mining market is the price of one
      kilowatt-<br>
      hour of electricity in bitcoin, because that determines the profitability
      of mining and<br>
      therefore the incentives to enter or exit the mining market.<br>
      Successfully Mining the Block<br>
      As we saw earlier, Jing’s node has constructed a candidate block and
      prepared it for<br>
      mining. Jing has several hardware mining rigs with application-specific
      integrated<br>
      circuits, where hundreds of thousands of integrated circuits run the
      SHA256 algo‐<br>
      rithm in parallel at incredible speeds. Many of these specialized machines
      are connec‐<br>
      ted to his mining node over USB or a local area network. Next, the mining
      node<br>
      running on Jing’s desktop transmits the block header to his mining
      hardware, which<br>
      starts testing trillions of nonces per second.<br>
      Successfully Mining the Block<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;237<br>
      Almost 11 minutes after starting to mine block 277,316, one of the
      hardware mining<br>
      machines finds a solution and sends it back to the mining node. When
      inserted into<br>
      the block header, the nonce 924,591,752 produces a block hash of:<br>
      0000000000000001b6b9a13b095e96db41c4a928b97ef2d944a9b31b2cc7bdc4<br>
      which is less than the target:<br>
      0000000000000003A30C00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br>
      Immediately, Jing’s mining node transmits the block to all its peers. They
      receive, vali‐<br>
      date, and then propagate the new block. As the block ripples out across
      the network,<br>
      each node adds it to its own copy of the blockchain, extending it to a new
      height of<br>
      277,316 blocks. As mining nodes receive and validate the block, they
      abandon their<br>
      efforts to find a block at the same height and immediately start computing
      the next<br>
      block in the chain, using Jing’s block as the “parent.” By building on top
      of Jing’s<br>
      newly discovered block, the other miners are essentially “voting” with
      their mining<br>
      power and endorsing Jing’s block and the chain it extends.<br>
      In the next section, we’ll look at the process each node uses to validate
      a block and<br>
      select the longest chain, creating the consensus that forms the
      decentralized block‐<br>
      chain.<br>
      Validating a New Block<br>
      The third step in bitcoin’s consensus mechanism is independent validation
      of each<br>
      new block by every node on the network. As the newly solved block moves
      across the<br>
      network, each node performs a series of tests to validate it before
      propagating it to its<br>
      peers. This ensures that only valid blocks are propagated on the network.
      The inde‐<br>
      pendent validation also ensures that miners who act honestly get their
      blocks incor‐<br>
      porated in the blockchain, thus earning the reward. Those miners who act<br>
      dishonestly have their blocks rejected and not only lose the reward, but
      also waste the<br>
      effort expended to find a Proof-of-Work solution, thus incurring the cost
      of electric‐<br>
      ity without compensation.<br>
      When a node receives a new block, it will validate the block by checking
      it against a<br>
      long list of criteria that must all be met; otherwise, the block is
      rejected. These criteria<br>
      can be seen in the Bitcoin Core client in the functions CheckBlock and
      CheckBlock<br>
      Header and include:<br>
      • The block data structure is syntactically valid<br>
      • The block header hash is less than the target (enforces the
      Proof-of-Work)<br>
      • The block timestamp is less than two hours in the future (allowing for
      time<br>
      errors)<br>
      • The block size is within acceptable limits<br>
      238<br>
      &nbsp;| Chapter 10: Mining and Consensus<br>
      • The first transaction (and only the first) is a coinbase transaction<br>
      • All transactions within the block are valid using the transaction
      checklist dis‐<br>
      cussed in “Independent Verification of Transactions” on page 218<br>
      The independent validation of each new block by every node on the network
      ensures<br>
      that the miners cannot cheat. In previous sections we saw how miners get
      to write a<br>
      transaction that awards them the new bitcoin created within the block and
      claim the<br>
      transaction fees. Why don’t miners write themselves a transaction for a
      thousand bit‐<br>
      coin instead of the correct reward? Because every node validates blocks
      according to<br>
      the same rules. An invalid coinbase transaction would make the entire
      block invalid,<br>
      which would result in the block being rejected and, therefore, that
      transaction would<br>
      never become part of the ledger. The miners have to construct a perfect
      block, based<br>
      on the shared rules that all nodes follow, and mine it with a correct
      solution to the<br>
      Proof-of-Work. To do so, they expend a lot of electricity in mining, and
      if they cheat,<br>
      all the electricity and effort is wasted. This is why independent
      validation is a key<br>
      component of decentralized consensus.<br>
      Assembling and Selecting Chains of Blocks<br>
      The final step in bitcoin’s decentralized consensus mechanism is the
      assembly of<br>
      blocks into chains and the selection of the chain with the most
      Proof-of-Work. Once<br>
      a node has validated a new block, it will then attempt to assemble a chain
      by connect‐<br>
      ing the block to the existing blockchain.<br>
      Nodes maintain three sets of blocks: those connected to the main
      blockchain, those<br>
      that form branches off the main blockchain (secondary chains), and
      finally, blocks<br>
      that do not have a known parent in the known chains (orphans). Invalid
      blocks are<br>
      rejected as soon as any one of the validation criteria fails and are
      therefore not<br>
      included in any chain.<br>
      The “main chain” at any time is whichever valid chain of blocks has the
      most cumula‐<br>
      tive Proof-of-Work associated with it. Under most circumstances this is
      also the chain<br>
      with the most blocks in it, unless there are two equal-length chains and
      one has more<br>
      Proof-of-Work. The main chain will also have branches with blocks that are
      “siblings”<br>
      to the blocks on the main chain. These blocks are valid but not part of
      the main<br>
      chain. They are kept for future reference, in case one of those chains is
      extended to<br>
      exceed the main chain in work. In the next section (“Blockchain Forks” on
      page 240),<br>
      we will see how secondary chains occur as a result of an almost
      simultaneous mining<br>
      of blocks at the same height.<br>
      When a new block is received, a node will try to slot it into the existing
      blockchain.<br>
      The node will look at the block’s “previous block hash” field, which is
      the reference to<br>
      the block’s parent. Then, the node will attempt to find that parent in the
      existing<br>
      blockchain. Most of the time, the parent will be the “tip” of the main
      chain, meaning<br>
      Assembling and Selecting Chains of Blocks<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;239<br>
      this new block extends the main chain. For example, the new block 277,316
      has a ref‐<br>
      erence to the hash of its parent block 277,315. Most nodes that receive
      277,316 will<br>
      already have block 277,315 as the tip of their main chain and will
      therefore link the<br>
      new block and extend that chain.<br>
      Sometimes, as we will see in “Blockchain Forks” on page 240, the new block
      extends a<br>
      chain that is not the main chain. In that case, the node will attach the
      new block to<br>
      the secondary chain it extends and then compare the work of the secondary
      chain to<br>
      the main chain. If the secondary chain has more cumulative work than the
      main<br>
      chain, the node will reconverge on the secondary chain, meaning it will
      select the sec‐<br>
      ondary chain as its new main chain, making the old main chain a secondary
      chain. If<br>
      the node is a miner, it will now construct a block extending this new,
      longer, chain.<br>
      If a valid block is received and no parent is found in the existing
      chains, that block is<br>
      considered an “orphan.” Orphan blocks are saved in the orphan block pool
      where<br>
      they will stay until their parent is received. Once the parent is received
      and linked<br>
      into the existing chains, the orphan can be pulled out of the orphan pool
      and linked<br>
      to the parent, making it part of a chain. Orphan blocks usually occur when
      two<br>
      blocks that were mined within a short time of each other are received in
      reverse order<br>
      (child before parent).<br>
      By selecting the greatest-cumulative-work valid chain, all nodes
      eventually achieve<br>
      network-wide consensus. Temporary discrepancies between chains are
      resolved even‐<br>
      tually as more work is added, extending one of the possible chains. Mining
      nodes<br>
      “vote” with their mining power by choosing which chain to extend by mining
      the<br>
      next block. When they mine a new block and extend the chain, the new block
      itself<br>
      represents their vote.<br>
      In the next section we will look at how discrepancies between competing
      chains<br>
      (forks) are resolved by the independent selection of the
      greatest-cumulative-work<br>
      chain.<br>
      Blockchain Forks<br>
      Because the blockchain is a decentralized data structure, different copies
      of it are not<br>
      always consistent. Blocks might arrive at different nodes at different
      times, causing<br>
      the nodes to have different perspectives of the blockchain. To resolve
      this, each node<br>
      always selects and attempts to extend the chain of blocks that represents
      the most<br>
      Proof-of-Work, also known as the longest chain or greatest cumulative work
      chain.<br>
      By summing the work recorded in each block in a chain, a node can
      calculate the<br>
      total amount of work that has been expended to create that chain. As long
      as all nodes<br>
      select the greatest-cumulative-work chain, the global bitcoin network
      eventually con‐<br>
      verges to a consistent state. Forks occur as temporary inconsistencies
      between ver‐<br>
      sions of the blockchain, which are resolved by eventual reconvergence as
      more blocks<br>
      are added to one of the forks.<br>
      240<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 10: Mining and Consensus<br>
      The blockchain forks described in this section occur naturally as a<br>
      result of transmission delays in the global network. We will also<br>
      look at deliberately induced forks later in this chapter.<br>
      In the next few diagrams, we follow the progress of a “fork” event across
      the network.<br>
      The diagram is a simplified representation of the bitcoin network. For
      illustration<br>
      purposes, different blocks are shown as different shapes (star, triangle,
      upside-down<br>
      triangle, rhombus), spreading across the network. Each node in the network
      is repre‐<br>
      sented as a circle.<br>
      Each node has its own perspective of the global blockchain. As each node
      receives<br>
      blocks from its neighbors, it updates its own copy of the blockchain,
      selecting the<br>
      greatest-cumulative-work chain. For illustration purposes, each node
      contains a<br>
      shape that represents the block that it believes is currently the tip of
      the main chain.<br>
      So, if you see a star shape in the node, that means that the star block is
      the tip of the<br>

      A “fork” occurs whenever there are two candidate blocks competing to form
      the<br>
      longest blockchain. This occurs under normal conditions whenever two
      miners solve<br>
      the Proof-of-Work algorithm within a short period of time from each other.
      As both<br>
      miners discover a solution for their respective candidate blocks, they
      immediately<br>
      broadcast their own “winning” block to their immediate neighbors who begin
      propa‐<br>
      gating the block across the network. Each node that receives a valid block
      will incor‐<br>
      porate it into its blockchain, extending the blockchain by one block. If
      that node later<br>
      sees another candidate block extending the same parent, it connects the
      second can‐<br>
      didate on a secondary chain. As a result, some nodes will “see” one
      candidate block<br>
      first, while other nodes will see the other candidate block and two
      competing versions<br>
      of the blockchain will emerge.<br>
      In Figure 10-3, we see two miners (Node X and Node Y) who mine two
      different<br>
      blocks almost simultaneously. Both of these blocks are children of the
      star block, and<br>
      extend the chain by building on top of the star block. To help us track
      it, one is visual‐<br>
      ized as a triangle block originating from Node X, and the other is shown
      as an upside-<br>
      down triangle block originating from Node Y.<br>

      simultaneously<br>

      &nbsp;| Chapter 10: Mining and Consensus<br>
      Let’s assume, for example, that a miner Node X finds a Proof-of-Work
      solution for a<br>
      block “triangle” that extends the blockchain, building on top of the
      parent block<br>
      “star.” Almost simultaneously, the miner Node Y who was also extending the
      chain<br>
      from block “star” finds a solution for block “upside-down triangle,” his
      candidate<br>
      block. Now, there are two possible blocks; one we call “triangle,”
      originating in Node<br>
      X; and one we call “upside-down triangle,” originating in Node Y. Both
      blocks are<br>
      valid, both blocks contain a valid solution to the Proof-of-Work, and both
      blocks<br>
      extend the same parent (block “star”). Both blocks likely contain most of
      the same<br>
      transactions, with only perhaps a few differences in the order of
      transactions.<br>
      As the two blocks propagate, some nodes receive block “triangle” first and
      some<br>
      receive block “upside-down triangle” first. As shown in Figure 10-4, the
      network<br>
      splits into two different perspectives of the blockchain; one side topped
      with a trian‐<br>
      gle block, the other with the upside-down-triangle block.<br>
      Figure 10-4. Visualization of a blockchain fork event: two blocks
      propagate, splitting the<br>
      network<br>
      In the diagram, a randomly chosen “Node X” received the triangle block
      first and<br>
      extended the star chain with it. Node X selected the chain with “triangle”
      block as the<br>
      main chain. Later, Node X also received the “upside-down triangle” block.
      Since it<br>
      was received second, it is assumed to have “lost” the race. Yet, the
      “upside-down tri‐<br>
      Assembling and Selecting Chains of Blocks<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;243<br>
      angle” block is not discarded. It is linked to the “star” block parent and
      forms a secon‐<br>
      dary chain. While Node X assumes it has correctly selected the winning
      chain, it<br>
      keeps the “losing” chain so that it has the information needed to
      reconverge if the<br>
      “losing” chain ends up “winning.”<br>
      On the other side of the network, Node Y constructs a blockchain based on
      its own<br>
      perspective of the sequence of events. It received “upside-down triangle”
      first and<br>
      elected that chain as the “winner.” When it later received “triangle”
      block, it connec‐<br>
      ted it to the “star” block parent as a secondary chain.<br>
      Neither side is “correct,” or “incorrect.” Both are valid perspectives of
      the blockchain.<br>
      Only in hindsight will one prevail, based on how these two competing
      chains are<br>
      extended by additional work.<br>
      Mining nodes whose perspective resembles Node X will immediately begin
      mining a<br>
      candidate block that extends the chain with “triangle” as its tip. By
      linking “triangle”<br>
      as the parent of their candidate block, they are voting with their hashing
      power. Their<br>
      vote supports the chain that they have elected as the main chain.<br>
      Any mining node whose perspective resembles Node Y will start building a
      candidate<br>
      node with “upside-down triangle” as its parent, extending the chain that
      they believe<br>
      is the main chain. And so, the race begins again.<br>
      Forks are almost always resolved within one block. While part of the
      network’s hash‐<br>
      ing power is dedicated to building on top of “triangle” as the parent,
      another part of<br>
      the hashing power is focused on building on top of “upside-down triangle.”
      Even if<br>
      the hashing power is almost evenly split, it is likely that one set of
      miners will find a<br>
      solution and propagate it before the other set of miners have found any
      solutions.<br>
      Let’s say, for example, that the miners building on top of “triangle” find
      a new block<br>
      “rhombus” that extends the chain (e.g., star-triangle-rhombus). They
      immediately<br>
      propagate this new block and the entire network sees it as a valid
      solution as shown<br>
      in Figure 10-5.<br>
      All nodes that had chosen “triangle” as the winner in the previous round
      will simply<br>
      extend the chain one more block. The nodes that chose “upside-down
      triangle” as the<br>
      winner, however, will now see two chains: star-triangle-rhombus and
      star-upside-<br>
      down-triangle. The chain star-triangle-rhombus is now longer (more
      cumulative<br>
      work) than the other chain. As a result, those nodes will set the chain
      star-triangle-<br>
      rhombus as the main chain and change the star-upside-down-triangle chain
      to a sec‐<br>
      ondary chain, as shown in Figure 10-6. This is a chain reconvergence,
      because those<br>
      nodes are forced to revise their view of the blockchain to incorporate the
      new evi‐<br>
      dence of a longer chain. Any miners working on extending the chain
      star-upside-<br>
      down-triangle will now stop that work because their candidate block is an
      “orphan,”<br>
      as its parent “upside-down-triangle” is no longer on the longest chain.
      The transac‐<br>
      tions within “upside-down-triangle” are re-inserted in the mempool for

      the next block, because the block they were in is no longer in the main
      chain. The<br>
      entire network reconverges on a single blockchain star-triangle-rhombus,
      with<br>
      “rhombus” as the last block in the chain. All miners immediately start
      working on<br>
      candidate blocks that reference “rhombus” as their parent to extend the
      star-triangle-<br>
      rhombus chain.<br>

      It is theoretically possible for a fork to extend to two blocks, if two
      blocks are found<br>
      almost simultaneously by miners on opposite “sides” of a previous fork.
      However, the<br>
      chance of that happening is very low. Whereas a one-block fork might occur
      every<br>
      day, a two-block fork occurs at most once every few weeks.<br>

      faster block<br>
      time would make transactions clear faster but lead to more frequent
      blockchain forks,<br>
      whereas a slower block time would decrease the number of forks but make

      Mining and the Hashing Race<br>
      Bitcoin mining is an extremely competitive industry. The hashing power has<br>
      increased exponentially every year of bitcoin’s existence. Some years the
      growth has<br>
      reflected a complete change of technology, such as in 2010 and 2011 when
      many min‐<br>
      ers switched from using CPU mining to GPU mining and field programmable
      gate<br>
      array (FPGA) mining. In 2013 the introduction of ASIC mining lead to
      another giant<br>
      leap in mining power, by placing the SHA256 function directly on silicon
      chips speci‐<br>
      alized for the purpose of mining. The first such chips could deliver more
      mining<br>
      power in a single box than the entire bitcoin network in 2010.<br>
      The following list shows the total hashing power of the bitcoin network,
      over the first<br>
      eight years of operation:<br>
      2009<br>
      0.5 MH/sec–8 MH/sec (16× growth)<br>
      2010<br>
      8 MH/sec–116 GH/sec (14,500× growth)<br>
      2011<br>
      16 GH/sec–9 TH/sec (562× growth)<br>
      2012<br>
      9 TH/sec–23 TH/sec (2.5× growth)<br>
      2013<br>
      23 TH/sec–10 PH/sec (450× growth)<br>

      10 PH/sec–300 PH/sec (3000× growth)<br>

      2016<br>
      800 PH/sec-2.5 EH/sec (312× growth))<br>
      In the chart in Figure 10-7, we can see that bitcoin network’s hashing
      power increased<br>
      over the past two years. As you can see, the competition between miners
      and the<br>
      Mining and the Hashing Race<br>

      &nbsp;247<br>
      growth of bitcoin has resulted in an exponential increase in the hashing

      hashes per second across the network).<br>
      Figure 10-7. Total hashing power, terahashes per second (TH/sec)<br>
      As the amount of hashing power applied to mining bitcoin has exploded, the
      diffi‐<br>
      culty has risen to match it. The difficulty metric in the chart shown in
      Figure 10-8 is<br>
      measured as a ratio of current difficulty over minimum difficulty (the
      difficulty of the<br>
      first block).<br>

      In the last two years, the ASIC mining chips have become increasingly
      denser,<br>
      approaching the cutting edge of silicon fabrication with a feature size
      (resolution) of<br>
      16 nanometers (nm). Currently, ASIC manufacturers are aiming to overtake
      general-<br>
      purpose CPU chip manufacturers, designing chips with a feature size of 14
      nm,<br>
      because the profitability of mining is driving this industry even faster
      than general<br>
      computing. There are no more giant leaps left in bitcoin mining, because
      the industry<br>
      has reached the forefront of Moore’s Law, which stipulates that computing
      density<br>
      will double approximately every 18 months. Still, the mining power of the
      network<br>
      continues to advance at an exponential pace as the race for higher density
      chips is<br>
      matched with a race for higher density data centers where thousands of
      these chips<br>
      can be deployed. It’s no longer about how much mining can be done with one
      chip,<br>
      but how many chips can be squeezed into a building, while still
      dissipating the heat<br>
      and providing adequate power.<br>
      The Extra Nonce Solution<br>
      Since 2012, bitcoin mining has evolved to resolve a fundamental limitation
      in the<br>
      structure of the block header. In the early days of bitcoin, a miner could
      find a block<br>
      by iterating through the nonce until the resulting hash was below the
      target. As diffi‐<br>
      culty increased, miners often cycled through all 4 billion values of the
      nonce without<br>
      finding a block. However, this was easily resolved by updating the block
      timestamp to<br>
      account for the elapsed time. Because the timestamp is part of the header,
      the change<br>
      would allow miners to iterate through the values of the nonce again with
      different<br>
      results. Once mining hardware exceeded 4 GH/sec, however, this approach
      became<br>
      increasingly difficult because the nonce values were exhausted in less
      than a second.<br>
      As ASIC mining equipment started pushing and then exceeding the TH/sec
      hash<br>
      rate, the mining software needed more space for nonce values in order to
      find valid<br>
      blocks. The timestamp could be stretched a bit, but moving it too far into
      the future<br>
      would cause the block to become invalid. A new source of “change” was
      needed in the<br>
      block header. The solution was to use the coinbase transaction as a source
      of extra<br>
      nonce values. Because the coinbase script can store between 2 and 100
      bytes of data,<br>
      miners started using that space as extra nonce space, allowing them to
      explore a<br>
      much larger range of block header values to find valid blocks. The
      coinbase transac‐<br>
      tion is included in the merkle tree, which means that any change in the
      coinbase<br>
      script causes the merkle root to change. Eight bytes of extra nonce, plus
      the 4 bytes of<br>
      “standard” nonce allow miners to explore a total 296 (8 followed by 28
      zeros) possibili‐<br>
      ties per second without having to modify the timestamp. If, in the future,
      miners<br>
      could run through all these possibilities, they could then modify the
      timestamp.<br>
      There is also more space in the coinbase script for future expansion of
      the extra<br>
      nonce space.<br>
      Mining and the Hashing Race<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;249<br>
      Successful blocks pay the reward to a pool bitcoin address, rather than
      individual<br>
      miners. The pool server will periodically make payments to the miners’
      bitcoin<br>
      addresses, once their share of the rewards has reached a certain
      threshold. Typically,<br>
      the pool server charges a percentage fee of the rewards for providing the
      pool-mining<br>
      service.<br>
      Miners participating in a pool split the work of searching for a solution
      to a candidate<br>
      block, earning “shares” for their mining contribution. The mining pool
      sets a higher<br>
      target (lower difficulty) for earning a share, typically more than 1,000
      times easier<br>
      than the bitcoin network’s target. When someone in the pool successfully
      mines a<br>
      block, the reward is earned by the pool and then shared with all miners in
      proportion<br>
      to the number of shares they contributed to the effort.<br>
      Pools are open to any miner, big or small, professional or amateur. A pool
      will there‐<br>
      fore have some participants with a single small mining machine, and others
      with a<br>
      garage full of high-end mining hardware. Some will be mining with a few
      tens of a<br>
      kilowatt of electricity, others will be running a data center consuming a
      megawatt of<br>
      power. How does a mining pool measure the individual contributions, so as
      to fairly<br>
      distribute the rewards, without the possibility of cheating? The answer is
      to use bit‐<br>
      coin’s Proof-of-Work algorithm to measure each pool miner’s contribution,
      but set at<br>
      a lower difficulty so that even the smallest pool miners win a share
      frequently enough<br>
      to make it worthwhile to contribute to the pool. By setting a lower
      difficulty for earn‐<br>
      ing shares, the pool measures the amount of work done by each miner. Each
      time a<br>
      pool miner finds a block header hash that is less than the pool target,
      she proves she<br>
      has done the hashing work to find that result. More importantly, the work
      to find<br>
      shares contributes, in a statistically measurable way, to the overall
      effort to find a hash<br>
      lower than the bitcoin network’s target. Thousands of miners trying to
      find low-value<br>
      hashes will eventually find one low enough to satisfy the bitcoin network
      target.<br>
      Let’s return to the analogy of a dice game. If the dice players are
      throwing dice with a<br>
      goal of throwing less than four (the overall network difficulty), a pool
      would set an<br>
      easier target, counting how many times the pool players managed to throw
      less than<br>
      eight. When pool players throw less than eight (the pool share target),
      they earn<br>
      shares, but they don’t win the game because they don’t achieve the game
      target (less<br>
      than four). The pool players will achieve the easier pool target much more
      often,<br>
      earning them shares very regularly, even when they don’t achieve the
      harder target of<br>
      winning the game. Every now and then, one of the pool players will throw a
      com‐<br>
      bined dice throw of less than four and the pool wins. Then, the earnings
      can be dis‐<br>
      tributed to the pool players based on the shares they earned. Even though
      the target<br>
      of eight-or-less wasn’t winning, it was a fair way to measure dice throws
      for the play‐<br>
      ers, and it occasionally produces a less-than-four throw.<br>
      Similarly, a mining pool will set a (higher and easier) pool target that
      will ensure that<br>
      an individual pool miner can find block header hashes that are less than
      the pool tar‐<br>

      old blocks practically immutable. Consensus attacks also do not affect the
      security of<br>
      the private keys and signing algorithm (ECDSA). A consensus attack cannot
      steal bit‐<br>
      coin, spend bitcoin without signatures, redirect bitcoin, or otherwise
      change past<br>
      transactions or ownership records. Consensus attacks can only affect the
      most recent<br>
      blocks and cause denial-of-service disruptions on the creation of future
      blocks.<br>
      One attack scenario against the consensus mechanism is called the “51%
      attack.” In<br>
      this scenario a group of miners, controlling a majority (51%) of the total
      network’s<br>
      hashing power, collude to attack bitcoin. With the ability to mine the
      majority of the<br>
      blocks, the attacking miners can cause deliberate “forks” in the
      blockchain and<br>
      double-spend transactions or execute denial-of-service attacks against
      specific trans‐<br>
      actions or addresses. A fork/double-spend attack is where the attacker
      causes previ‐<br>
      ously confirmed blocks to be invalidated by forking below them and
      re-converging<br>
      on an alternate chain. With sufficient power, an attacker can invalidate
      six or more<br>
      blocks in a row, causing transactions that were considered immutable (six
      confirma‐<br>
      tions) to be invalidated. Note that a double-spend can only be done on the
      attacker’s<br>
      own transactions, for which the attacker can produce a valid signature.
      Double-<br>
      spending one’s own transactions is profitable if by invalidating a
      transaction the<br>
      attacker can get an irreversible exchange payment or product without
      paying for it.<br>
      Let’s examine a practical example of a 51% attack. In the first chapter,
      we looked at a<br>
      transaction between Alice and Bob for a cup of coffee. Bob, the cafe
      owner, is willing<br>
      to accept payment for cups of coffee without waiting for confirmation
      (mining in a<br>
      block), because the risk of a double-spend on a cup of coffee is low in
      comparison to<br>
      the convenience of rapid customer service. This is similar to the practice
      of coffee<br>
      shops that accept credit card payments without a signature for amounts
      below $25,<br>
      because the risk of a credit-card chargeback is low while the cost of
      delaying the<br>
      transaction to obtain a signature is comparatively larger. In contrast,
      selling a more<br>
      expensive item for bitcoin runs the risk of a double-spend attack, where
      the buyer<br>
      broadcasts a competing transaction that spends the same inputs (UTXO) and
      cancels<br>
      the payment to the merchant. A double-spend attack can happen in two ways:
      either<br>
      before a transaction is confirmed, or if the attacker takes advantage of a
      blockchain<br>
      fork to undo several blocks. A 51% attack allows attackers to double-spend
      their own<br>
      transactions in the new chain, thus undoing the corresponding transaction
      in the old<br>
      chain.<br>
      In our example, malicious attacker Mallory goes to Carol’s gallery and
      purchases a<br>
      beautiful triptych painting depicting Satoshi Nakamoto as Prometheus.
      Carol sells<br>
      “The Great Fire” paintings for $250,000 in bitcoin to Mallory. Instead of
      waiting for<br>
      six or more confirmations on the transaction, Carol wraps and hands the
      paintings to<br>
      Mallory after only one confirmation. Mallory works with an accomplice,
      Paul, who<br>
      operates a large mining pool, and the accomplice launches a 51% attack as
      soon as<br>
      Mallory’s transaction is included in a block. Paul directs the mining pool
      to remine<br>
      the same block height as the block containing Mallory’s transaction,
      replacing Mal‐<br>
      254<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 10: Mining and Consensus<br>
      lory’s payment to Carol with a transaction that double-spends the same
      input as Mal‐<br>
      lory’s payment. The double-spend transaction consumes the same UTXO and
      pays it<br>
      back to Mallory’s wallet, instead of paying it to Carol, essentially
      allowing Mallory to<br>
      keep the bitcoin. Paul then directs the mining pool to mine an additional
      block, so as<br>
      to make the chain containing the double-spend transaction longer than the
      original<br>
      chain (causing a fork below the block containing Mallory’s transaction).
      When the<br>
      blockchain fork resolves in favor of the new (longer) chain, the
      double-spent transac‐<br>
      tion replaces the original payment to Carol. Carol is now missing the
      three paintings<br>
      and also has no bitcoin payment. Throughout all this activity, Paul’s
      mining pool par‐<br>
      ticipants might remain blissfully unaware of the double-spend attempt,
      because they<br>
      mine with automated miners and cannot monitor every transaction or block.<br>
      To protect against this kind of attack, a merchant selling large-value
      items must wait<br>
      at least six confirmations before giving the product to the buyer.
      Alternatively, the<br>
      merchant should use an escrow multisignature account, again waiting for
      several<br>
      confirmations after the escrow account is funded. The more confirmations
      elapse, the<br>
      harder it becomes to invalidate a transaction with a 51% attack. For
      high-value items,<br>
      payment by bitcoin will still be convenient and efficient even if the
      buyer has to wait<br>
      24 hours for delivery, which would correspond to approximately 144
      confirmations.<br>
      In addition to a double-spend attack, the other scenario for a consensus
      attack is to<br>
      deny service to specific bitcoin participants (specific bitcoin
      addresses). An attacker<br>
      with a majority of the mining power can simply ignore specific
      transactions. If they<br>
      are included in a block mined by another miner, the attacker can
      deliberately fork<br>
      and remine that block, again excluding the specific transactions. This
      type of attack<br>
      can result in a sustained denial-of-service against a specific address or
      set of addresses<br>
      for as long as the attacker controls the majority of the mining power.<br>
      Despite its name, the 51% attack scenario doesn’t actually require 51% of
      the hashing<br>
      power. In fact, such an attack can be attempted with a smaller percentage
      of the hash‐<br>
      ing power. The 51% threshold is simply the level at which such an attack
      is almost<br>
      guaranteed to succeed. A consensus attack is essentially a tug-of-war for
      the next<br>
      block and the “stronger” group is more likely to win. With less hashing
      power, the<br>
      probability of success is reduced, because other miners control the
      generation of<br>
      some blocks with their “honest” mining power. One way to look at it is
      that the more<br>
      hashing power an attacker has, the longer the fork he can deliberately
      create, the<br>
      more blocks in the recent past he can invalidate, or the more blocks in
      the future he<br>
      can control. Security research groups have used statistical modeling to
      claim that var‐<br>
      ious types of consensus attacks are possible with as little as 30% of the
      hashing power.<br>
      The massive increase of total hashing power has arguably made bitcoin
      impervious to<br>
      attacks by a single miner. There is no possible way for a solo miner to
      control more<br>
      than a small percentage of the total mining power. However, the
      centralization of<br>
      control caused by mining pools has introduced the risk of for-profit
      attacks by a min‐<br>
      Consensus Attacks<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;255<br>
      ing pool operator. The pool operator in a managed pool controls the
      construction of<br>
      candidate blocks and also controls which transactions are included. This
      gives the<br>
      pool operator the power to exclude transactions or introduce double-spend
      transac‐<br>
      tions. If such abuse of power is done in a limited and subtle way, a pool
      operator<br>
      could conceivably profit from a consensus attack without being noticed.<br>
      Not all attackers will be motivated by profit, however. One potential
      attack scenario is<br>
      where an attacker intends to disrupt the bitcoin network without the
      possibility of<br>
      profiting from such disruption. A malicious attack aimed at crippling
      bitcoin would<br>
      require enormous investment and covert planning, but could conceivably be<br>
      launched by a well-funded, most likely state-sponsored, attacker.
      Alternatively, a well-<br>
      funded attacker could attack bitcoin’s consensus by simultaneously
      amassing mining<br>
      hardware, compromising pool operators, and attacking other pools with
      denial-of-<br>
      service. All of these scenarios are theoretically possible, but
      increasingly impractical<br>
      as the bitcoin network’s overall hashing power continues to grow
      exponentially.<br>
      Undoubtedly, a serious consensus attack would erode confidence in bitcoin
      in the<br>
      short term, possibly causing a significant price decline. However, the
      bitcoin network<br>
      and software are constantly evolving, so consensus attacks would be met
      with imme‐<br>
      diate countermeasures by the bitcoin community, making bitcoin hardier,
      stealthier,<br>
      and more robust than ever.<br>
      Changing the Consensus Rules<br>
      The rules of consensus determine the validity of transactions and blocks.
      These rules<br>
      are the basis for collaboration between all bitcoin nodes and are
      responsible for the<br>
      convergence of all local perspectives into a single consistent blockchain
      across the<br>
      entire network.<br>
      While the consensus rules are invariable in the short term and must be
      consistent<br>
      across all nodes, they are not invariable in the long term. In order to
      evolve and<br>
      develop the bitcoin system, the rules have to change from time to time to
      accommo‐<br>
      date new features, improvements, or bug fixes. Unlike traditional software
      develop‐<br>
      ment, however, upgrades to a consensus system are much more difficult and
      require<br>
      coordination between all the participants.<br>
      Hard Forks<br>
      In “Blockchain Forks” on page 240 we looked at how the bitcoin network may
      briefly<br>
      diverge, with two parts of the network following two different branches of
      the block‐<br>
      chain for a short time. We saw how this process occurs naturally, as part
      of the nor‐<br>
      mal operation of the network and how the network reconverges on a common<br>
      blockchain after one or more blocks are mined.<br>
      256<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 10: Mining and Consensus<br>
      There is another scenario in which the network may diverge into following
      two<br>
      chains: a change in the consensus rules. This type of fork is called a
      hard fork, because<br>
      after the fork the network does not reconverge onto a single chain.
      Instead, the two<br>
      chains evolve independently. Hard forks occur when part of the network is
      operating<br>
      under a different set of consensus rules than the rest of the network.
      This may occur<br>
      because of a bug or because of a deliberate change in the implementation
      of the con‐<br>
      sensus rules.<br>
      Hard forks can be used to change the rules of consensus, but they require
      coordina‐<br>
      tion between all participants in the system. Any nodes that do not upgrade
      to the new<br>
      consensus rules are unable to participate in the consensus mechanism and
      are forced<br>
      onto a separate chain at the moment of the hard fork. Thus, a change
      introduced by a<br>
      hard fork can be thought of as not “forward compatible,” in that
      nonupgraded sys‐<br>
      tems can no longer process the new consensus rules.<br>
      Let’s examine the mechanics of a hard fork with a specific example.<br>
      Figure 10-9 shows a blockchain with two forks. At block height 4, a
      one-block fork<br>
      occurs. This is the type of spontaneous fork we saw in “Blockchain Forks”
      on page<br>
      240. With the mining of block 5, the network reconverges on one chain and
      the fork<br>
      is resolved.<br>
      Figure 10-9. A blockchain with forks<br>
      Later, however, at block height 6, a hard fork occurs. Let’s assume that a
      new imple‐<br>
      mentation of the client is released with a change in the consensus rules.
      Starting on<br>
      block height 7, miners running this new implementation will accept a new
      type of<br>
      digital signature, let’s call it a “Smores” signature, that is not ECDSA
      based. Immedi‐<br>
      ately after, a node running the new implementation creates a transaction
      that contains<br>
      a Smores signature and a miner with the updated software mines block 7b
      containing<br>
      this transaction.<br>
      Any node or miner that has not upgraded the software to validate Smores
      signatures<br>
      is now unable to process block 7b. From their perspective, both the
      transaction that<br>
      contained a Smores signature and block 7b that contained that transaction
      are inva‐<br>
      lid, because they are evaluating them based upon the old consensus rules.
      These<br>
      nodes will reject the transaction and the block and will not propagate
      them. Any min‐<br>
      ers that are using the old rules will not accept block 7b and will
      continue to mine a<br>
      Changing the Consensus Rules<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;257<br>
      candidate block whose parent is block 6. In fact, miners using the old
      rules may not<br>
      even receive block 7b if all the nodes they are connected to are also
      obeying the old<br>
      rules and therefore not propagating the block. Eventually, they will be
      able to mine<br>
      block 7a, which is valid under the old rules and does not contain any
      transactions<br>
      with Smores signatures.<br>
      The two chains continue to diverge from this point. Miners on the “b”
      chain will con‐<br>
      tinue to accept and mine transactions containing Smores signatures, while
      miners on<br>
      the “a” chain will continue to ignore these transactions. Even if block 8b
      does not con‐<br>
      tain any Smores-signed transactions, the miners on the “a” chain cannot
      process it. To<br>
      them it appears to be an orphan block, as its parent “7b” is not
      recognized as a valid<br>
      block.<br>
      Hard Forks: Software, Network, Mining, and Chain<br>
      For software developers, the term “fork” has another meaning, adding
      confusion to<br>
      the term “hard fork.” In open source software, a fork occurs when a group
      of develop‐<br>
      ers choose to follow a different software roadmap and start a competing
      implementa‐<br>
      tion of an open source project. We’ve already discussed two circumstances
      that will<br>
      lead to a hard fork: a bug in the consensus rules and a deliberate
      modification of the<br>
      consensus rules. In the case of a deliberate change to the consensus
      rules, a software<br>
      fork precedes the hard fork. However, for this type of hard fork to occur,
      a new soft‐<br>
      ware implementation of the consensus rules must be developed, adopted, and<br>
      launched.<br>
      Examples of software forks that have attempted to change consensus rules
      include<br>
      Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, and most recently Bitcoin Unlimited. However,
      none of<br>
      these software forks have resulted in a hard fork. While a software fork
      is a necessary<br>
      precondition, it is not in itself sufficient for a hard fork to occur. For
      a hard fork to<br>
      occur, the competing implementation must be adopted and the new rules
      activated,<br>
      by miners, wallets, and intermediary nodes. Conversely, there are numerous
      alterna‐<br>
      tive implementations of Bitcoin Core, and even software forks, that do not
      change the<br>
      consensus rules and barring a bug, can coexist on the network and
      interoperate<br>
      without causing a hard fork.<br>
      Consensus rules may differ in obvious and explicit ways, in the validation
      of transac‐<br>
      tions or blocks. The rules may also differ in more subtle ways, in the
      implementation<br>
      of the consensus rules as they apply to bitcoin scripts or cryptographic
      primitives<br>
      such as digital signatures. Finally, the consensus rules may differ in
      unanticipated<br>
      ways because of implicit consensus constraints imposed by system
      limitations or<br>
      implementation details. An example of the latter was seen in the
      unanticipated hard<br>
      fork during the upgrade of Bitcoin Core 0.7 to 0.8, which was caused by a
      limitation<br>
      in the Berkley DB implementation used to store blocks.<br>
      258<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 10: Mining and Consensus<br>
      Conceptually, we can think of a hard fork as developing in four stages: a
      software<br>
      fork, a network fork, a mining fork, and a chain fork.<br>
      The process begins when an alternative implementation of the client, with
      modified<br>
      consensus rules, is created by developers.<br>
      When this forked implementation is deployed in the network, a certain
      percentage of<br>
      miners, wallet users, and intermediate nodes may adopt and run this
      implementation.<br>
      A resulting fork will depend upon whether the new consensus rules apply to
      blocks,<br>
      transactions, or some other aspect of the system. If the new consensus
      rules pertain to<br>
      transactions, then a wallet creating a transaction under the new rules may
      precipitate<br>
      a network fork, followed by a hard fork when the transaction is mined into
      a block. If<br>
      the new rules pertain to blocks, then the hard fork process will begin
      when a block is<br>
      mined under the new rules.<br>
      First, the network will fork. Nodes based on the original implementation
      of the con‐<br>
      sensus rules will reject any transactions and blocks that are created
      under the new<br>
      rules. Furthermore, the nodes following the original consensus rules will
      temporarily<br>
      ban and disconnect from any nodes that are sending them these invalid
      transactions<br>
      and blocks. As a result, the network will partition into two: old nodes
      will only<br>
      remain connected to old nodes and new nodes will only be connected to new
      nodes.<br>
      A single transaction or block based on the new rules will ripple through
      the network<br>
      and result in the partition into two networks.<br>
      Once a miner using the new rules mines a block, the mining power and chain
      will<br>
      also fork. New miners will mine on top of the new block, while old miners
      will mine a<br>
      separate chain based on the old rules. The partitioned network will make
      it so that the<br>
      miners operating on separate consensus rules won’t likely receive each
      other’s blocks,<br>
      as they are connected to two separate networks.<br>
      Diverging Miners and Difficulty<br>
      As miners diverge into mining two different chains, the hashing power is
      split<br>
      between the chains. The mining power can be split in any proportion
      between the<br>
      two chains. The new rules may only be followed by a minority, or by the
      vast majority<br>
      of the mining power.<br>
      Let’s assume, for example, an 80%–20% split, with the majority of the
      mining power<br>
      using the new consensus rules. Let’s also assume that the fork occurs
      immediately<br>
      after a retargeting period.<br>
      The two chains would each inherit the difficulty from the retargeting
      period. The new<br>
      consensus rules would have 80% of the previously available mining power
      committed<br>
      to them. From the perspective of this chain, the mining power has suddenly
      declined<br>
      by 20% vis-a-vis the previous period. Blocks will be found on average
      every 12<br>
      minutes, representing the 20% decline in mining power available to extend
      this chain.<br>
      Changing the Consensus Rules<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;259<br>
      This rate of block issuance will continue (barring any changes in hashing
      power) until<br>
      2016 blocks are mined, which will take approximately 24,192 minutes (at 12
      minutes<br>
      per block), or 16.8 days. After 16.8 days, a retarget will occur and the
      difficulty will<br>
      adjust (reduced by 20%) to produce 10-minute blocks again, based on the
      reduced<br>
      amount of hashing power in this chain.<br>
      The minority chain, mining under the old rules with only 20% of the
      hashing power,<br>
      will face a much more difficult task. On this chain, blocks will now be
      mined every 50<br>
      minutes on average. The difficulty will not be adjusted for 2016 blocks,
      which will<br>
      take 100,800 minutes, or approximately 10 weeks to mine. Assuming a fixed
      capacity<br>
      per block, this will also result in a reduction of transaction capacity by
      a factor of 5, as<br>
      there are fewer blocks per hour available to record transactions.<br>
      Contentious Hard Forks<br>
      This is the dawn of consensus software development. Just as open source
      develop‐<br>
      ment changed both the methods and products of software and created new
      method‐<br>
      ologies, new tools, and new communities in its wake, consensus software<br>
      development also represents a new frontier in computer science. Out of the
      debates,<br>
      experiments, and tribulations of the bitcoin development roadmap, we will
      see new<br>
      development tools, practices, methodologies, and communities emerge.<br>
      Hard forks are seen as risky because they force a minority to either
      upgrade or<br>
      remain on a minority chain. The risk of splitting the entire system into
      two compet‐<br>
      ing systems is seen by many as an unacceptable risk. As a result, many
      developers are<br>
      reluctant to use the hard fork mechanism to implement upgrades to the
      consensus<br>
      rules, unless there is near-unanimous support from the entire network. Any
      hard fork<br>
      proposals that do not have near-unanimous support are considered too
      “contentious”<br>
      to attempt without risking a partition of the system.<br>
      The issue of hard forks is highly controversial in the bitcoin development
      commu‐<br>
      nity, especially as it relates to any proposed changes to the consensus
      rules controlling<br>
      the maximum block size limit. Some developers are opposed to any form of
      hard<br>
      fork, seeing it as too risky. Others see the mechanism of hard fork as an
      essential tool<br>
      for upgrading the consensus rules in a way that avoids “technical debt”
      and provides a<br>
      clean break with the past. Finally, some developers see hard forks as a
      mechanism<br>
      that should be used rarely, with a lot of advance planning and only under
      near-<br>
      unanimous consensus.<br>
      Already we have seen the emergence of new methodologies to address the
      risks of<br>
      hard forks. In the next section, we will look at soft forks, and the
      BIP-34 and BIP-9<br>
      methods for signaling and activation of consensus modifications.<br>
      260<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 10: Mining and Consensus<br>
      Soft Forks<br>
      Not all consensus rule changes cause a hard fork. Only consensus changes
      that are<br>
      forward-incompatible cause a fork. If the change is implemented in such a
      way that<br>
      an unmodified client still sees the transaction or block as valid under
      the previous<br>
      rules, the change can happen without a fork.<br>
      The term soft fork was introduced to distinguish this upgrade method from
      a “hard<br>
      fork.” In practice, a soft fork is not a fork at all. A soft fork is a
      forward-compatible<br>
      change to the consensus rules that allows unupgraded clients to continue
      to operate<br>
      in consensus with the new rules.<br>
      One aspect of soft forks that is not immediately obvious is that soft fork
      upgrades can<br>
      only be used to constrain the consensus rules, not to expand them. In
      order to be for‐<br>
      ward compatible, transactions and blocks created under the new rules must
      be valid<br>
      under the old rules too, but not vice versa. The new rules can only limit
      what is valid;<br>
      otherwise, they will trigger a hard fork when rejected under the old
      rules.<br>
      Soft forks can be implemented in a number of ways—the term does not define
      a sin‐<br>
      gle method, rather a set of methods that all have one thing in common:
      they don’t<br>
      require all nodes to upgrade or force nonupgraded nodes out of consensus.<br>
      Soft forks redefining NOP opcodes<br>
      A number of soft forks have been implemented in bitcoin, based on the re-<br>
      interpretation of NOP opcodes. Bitcoin Script had ten opcodes reserved for
      future<br>
      use, NOP1 through NOP10. Under the consensus rules, the presence of these<br>
      opcodes in a script is interpreted as a null-potent operator, meaning they
      have no<br>
      effect. Execution continues after the NOP opcode as if it wasn’t there.<br>
      A soft fork therefore can modify the semantics of a NOP code to give it
      new meaning.<br>
      For example, BIP-65 (CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) reinterpreted the NOP2 opcode.
      Clients<br>
      implementing BIP-65 interpret NOP2 as OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and impose an<br>
      absolute locktime consensus rule on UTXO that contain this opcode in their
      locking<br>
      scripts. This change is a soft fork because a transaction that is valid
      under BIP-65 is<br>
      also valid on any client that is not implementing (ignorant of) BIP-65. To
      the old cli‐<br>
      ents, the script contains an NOP code, which is ignored.<br>
      Other ways to soft fork upgrade<br>
      The reinterpretation of NOP opcodes was both planned for and an obvious
      mecha‐<br>
      nism for consensus upgrades. Recently, however, another soft fork
      mechanism was<br>
      introduced that does not rely on NOP opcodes for a very specific type of
      consensus<br>
      change. This is examined in more detail in Appendix D. Segwit is an
      architectural<br>
      change to the structure of a transaction, which moves the unlocking script
      (witness)<br>
      from inside the transaction to an external data structure (segregating
      it). Segwit was<br>
      Changing the Consensus Rules<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;261<br>
      initially envisioned as a hard fork upgrade, as it modified a fundamental
      structure<br>
      (transaction). In November 2015, a developer working on Bitcoin Core
      proposed a<br>
      mechanism by which segwit could be introduced as a soft fork. The
      mechanism used<br>
      for this is a modification of the locking script of UTXO created under
      segwit rules,<br>
      such that unmodified clients see the locking script as redeemable with any
      unlocking<br>
      script whatsoever. As a result, segwit can be introduced without requiring
      every node<br>
      to upgrade or split from the chain: a soft fork.<br>
      It is likely that there are other, yet to be discovered, mechanisms by
      which upgrades<br>
      can be made in a forward-compatible way as a soft fork.<br>
      Criticisms of Soft Forks<br>
      Soft forks based on the NOP opcodes are relatively uncontroversial. The
      NOP<br>
      opcodes were placed in Bitcoin Script with the explicit goal of allowing
      non-<br>
      disruptive upgrades.<br>
      However, many developers are concerned that other methods of soft fork
      upgrades<br>
      make unacceptable tradeoffs. Common criticisms of soft fork changes
      include:<br>
      Technical debt<br>
      Because soft forks are more technically complex than a hard fork upgrade,
      they<br>
      introduce technical debt, a term that refers to increasing the future cost
      of code<br>
      maintenance because of design tradeoffs made in the past. Code complexity
      in<br>
      turn increases the likelihood of bugs and security vulnerabilities.<br>
      Validation relaxation<br>
      Unmodified clients see transactions as valid, without evaluating the
      modified<br>
      consensus rules. In effect, the unmodified clients are not validating
      using the full<br>
      range of consensus rules, as they are blind to the new rules. This applies
      to NOP-<br>
      based upgrades, as well as other soft fork upgrades.<br>
      Irreversible upgrades<br>
      Because soft forks create transactions with additional consensus
      constraints, they<br>
      become irreversible upgrades in practice. If a soft fork upgrade were to
      be<br>
      reversed after being activated, any transactions created under the new
      rules could<br>
      result in a loss of funds under the old rules. For example, if a CLTV
      transaction is<br>
      evaluated under the old rules, there is no timelock constraint and it can
      be spent<br>
      whenever. Therefore, critics contend that a failed soft fork that had to
      be reversed<br>
      because of a bug would almost certainly lead to loss of funds.<br>
      Soft Fork Signaling with Block Version<br>
      Since soft forks allow unmodified clients to continue to operate within
      consensus, the<br>
      mechanism for “activating” a soft fork is through miners signaling
      readiness: a major‐<br>
      262<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 10: Mining and Consensus<br>
      ity of miners must agree that they are ready and willing to enforce the
      new consensus<br>
      rules. To coordinate their actions, there is a signaling mechanism that
      allows them to<br>
      show their support for a consensus rule change. This mechanism was
      introduced<br>
      with the activation of BIP-34 in March 2013 and replaced by the activation
      of BIP-9<br>
      in July 2016.<br>
      BIP-34 Signaling and Activation<br>
      The first implementation, in BIP-34, used the block version field to allow
      miners to<br>
      signal readiness for a specific consensus rule change. Prior to BIP-34,
      the block ver‐<br>
      sion was set to “1” by convention not enforced by consensus.<br>
      BIP-34 defined a consensus rule change that required the coinbase field
      (input) of the<br>
      coinbase transaction to contain the block height. Prior to BIP-34, the
      coinbase could<br>
      contain any arbitrary data the miners chose to include. After activation
      of BIP-34,<br>
      valid blocks had to contain a specific block-height at the beginning of
      the coinbase<br>
      and be identified with a version number greater than or equal to “2.”<br>
      To signal the change and activation of BIP-34, miners set the block
      version to “2,”<br>
      instead of “1.” This did not immediately make version “1” blocks invalid.
      Once activa‐<br>
      ted, version “1” blocks would become invalid and all version “2” blocks
      would be<br>
      required to contain the block height in the coinbase to be valid.<br>
      BIP-34 defined a two-step activation mechanism, based on a rolling window
      of 1000<br>
      blocks. A miner would signal his or her individual readiness for BIP-34 by
      construct‐<br>
      ing blocks with “2” as the version number. Strictly speaking, these blocks
      did not yet<br>
      have to comply with the new consensus rule of including the block-height
      in the<br>
      coinbase transaction because the consensus rule had not yet been
      activated. The con‐<br>
      sensus rules activated in two steps:<br>
      • If 75% (750 of the most recent 1000 blocks) are marked with version “2,”
      then<br>
      version “2” blocks must contain block height in the coinbase transaction
      or they<br>
      are rejected as invalid. Version “1” blocks are still accepted by the
      network and<br>
      do not need to contain block-height. The old and new consensus rules
      coexist<br>
      during this period.<br>
      • When 95% (950 of the most recent 1000 blocks) are version “2,” version
      “1”<br>
      blocks are no longer considered valid. Version “2” blocks are valid only
      if they<br>
      contain the block-height in the coinbase (as per the previous threshold).
      There‐<br>
      after, all blocks must comply with the new consensus rules, and all valid
      blocks<br>
      must contain block-height in the coinbase transaction.<br>
      After successful signaling and activation under the BIP-34 rules, this
      mechanism was<br>
      used twice more to activate soft forks:<br>
      Soft Fork Signaling with Block Version<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;263<br>
      • BIP-66 Strict DER Encoding of Signatures was activated by BIP-34 style
      signaling<br>
      with a block version “3” and invalidating version “2” blocks.<br>
      • BIP-65 CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY was activated by BIP-34 style signaling with
      a<br>
      block version “4” and invalidating version “3” blocks.<br>
      After the activation of BIP-65, the signaling and activation mechanism of
      BIP-34 was<br>
      retired and replaced with the BIP-9 signaling mechanism described next.<br>
      The standard is defined in BIP-34 (Block v2, Height in Coinbase).<br>
      BIP-9 Signaling and Activation<br>
      The mechanism used by BIP-34, BIP-66, and BIP-65 was successful in
      activating three<br>
      soft forks. However, it was replaced because it had several limitations:<br>
      • By using the integer value of the block version, only one soft fork
      could be activa‐<br>
      ted at a time, so it required coordination between soft fork proposals and
      agree‐<br>
      ment on their prioritization and sequencing.<br>
      • Furthermore, because the block version was incremented, the mechanism
      didn’t<br>
      offer a straightforward way to reject a change and then propose a
      different one. If<br>
      old clients were still running, they could mistake signaling for a new
      change as<br>
      signaling for the previously rejected change.<br>
      • Each new change irrevocably reduced the available block versions for
      future<br>
      changes.<br>
      BIP-9 was proposed to overcome these challenges and improve the rate and
      ease of<br>
      implementing future changes.<br>
      BIP-9 interprets the block version as a bit field instead of an integer.
      Because the<br>
      block version was originally used as an integer, versions 1 through 4,
      only 29 bits<br>
      remain available to be used as a bit field. This leaves 29 bits that can
      be used to inde‐<br>
      pendently and simultaneously signal readiness on 29 different proposals.<br>
      BIP-9 also sets a maximum time for signaling and activation. This way
      miners don’t<br>
      need to signal forever. If a proposal is not activated within the TIMEOUT
      period<br>
      (defined in the proposal), the proposal is considered rejected. The
      proposal may be<br>
      resubmitted for signaling with a different bit, renewing the activation
      period.<br>
      Furthermore, after the TIMEOUT has passed and a feature has been activated
      or rejec‐<br>
      ted, the signaling bit can be reused for another feature without
      confusion. Therefore,<br>
      up to 29 changes can be signaled in parallel and after TIMEOUT the bits
      can be “recy‐<br>
      cled” to propose new changes.<br>

      reflective of this real‐<br>
      ity.<br>
      It is important to recognize that there is no perfect solution for

      without vulnerabilities should be vulnerable only to a compromise of the
      bitcoin con‐<br>
      sensus mechanism, meaning that its root of trust is based on the strongest
      part of the<br>
      bitcoin security architecture.<br>
      The numerous examples of hacked bitcoin exchanges serve to underscore this
      point<br>
      because their security architecture and design fails even under the most
      casual scru‐<br>
      tiny. These centralized implementations had invested trust explicitly in
      numerous<br>
      components outside the bitcoin blockchain, such as hot wallets,
      centralized ledger<br>
      databases, vulnerable encryption keys, and similar schemes.<br>
      User Security Best Practices<br>
      Humans have used physical security controls for thousands of years. By
      comparison,<br>
      our experience with digital security is less than 50 years old. Modern
      general-purpose<br>
      operating systems are not very secure and not particularly suited to
      storing digital<br>
      money. Our computers are constantly exposed to external threats via
      always-on inter‐<br>
      net connections. They run thousands of software components from hundreds
      of<br>
      authors, often with unconstrained access to the user’s files. A single
      piece of rogue<br>
      software, among the many thousands installed on your computer, can
      compromise<br>
      your keyboard and files, stealing any bitcoin stored in wallet
      applications. The level of<br>
      computer maintenance required to keep a computer virus-free and
      trojan-free is<br>
      beyond the skill level of all but a tiny minority of computer users.<br>
      Despite decades of research and advancements in information security,
      digital assets<br>
      are still woefully vulnerable to a determined adversary. Even the most
      highly pro‐<br>
      tected and restricted systems, in financial services companies,
      intelligence agencies,<br>
      and defense contractors, are frequently breached. Bitcoin creates digital
      assets that<br>
      have intrinsic value and can be stolen and diverted to new owners
      instantly and irrev‐<br>
      ocably. This creates a massive incentive for hackers. Until now, hackers
      had to convert<br>
      identity information or account tokens—such as credit cards and bank
      accounts—<br>
      into value after compromising them. Despite the difficulty of fencing and
      laundering<br>
      financial information, we have seen ever-escalating thefts. Bitcoin
      escalates this prob‐<br>
      lem because it doesn’t need to be fenced or laundered; it is intrinsic
      value within a<br>
      digital asset.<br>
      Fortunately, bitcoin also creates the incentives to improve computer
      security.<br>
      Whereas previously the risk of computer compromise was vague and indirect,
      bitcoin<br>
      makes these risks clear and obvious. Holding bitcoin on a computer serves
      to focus<br>
      the user’s mind on the need for improved computer security. As a direct
      result of the<br>
      proliferation and increased adoption of bitcoin and other digital
      currencies, we have<br>
      seen an escalation in both hacking techniques and security solutions. In
      simple terms,<br>
      hackers now have a very juicy target and users have a clear incentive to
      defend them‐<br>
      selves.<br>

      Applications<br>
      Let’s now build on our understanding of bitcoin by looking at it as an
      application plat‐<br>
      form. Nowadays, many people use the term “blockchain” to refer to any
      application<br>
      platform that shares the design principles of bitcoin. The term is often
      misused and<br>
      applied to many things that fail to deliver the primary features that
      bitcoin’s block‐<br>
      chain delivers.<br>
      In this chapter we will look at the features offered by the bitcoin
      blockchain, as an<br>
      application platform. We will consider the application building
      primitives, which<br>
      form the building blocks of any blockchain application. We will look at
      several impor‐<br>
      tant applications that use these primitives, such as colored coins,
      payment (state)<br>
      channels, and routed payment channels (Lightning Network).<br>
      Introduction<br>
      The bitcoin system was designed as a decentralized currency and payment
      system.<br>
      However, most of its functionality is derived from much lower-level
      constructs that<br>
      can be used for much broader applications. Bitcoin wasn’t built with
      components<br>
      such as accounts, users, balances, and payments. Instead, it uses a
      transactional<br>
      scripting language with low-level cryptographic functions, as we saw in
      Chapter 6.<br>
      Just like the higher-level concepts of accounts, balances, and payments
      can be derived<br>
      from these basic primitives, so can many other complex applications. Thus,
      the bit‐<br>
      coin blockchain can become an application platform offering trust services
      to appli‐<br>
      cations, such as smart contracts, far surpassing the original purpose of
      digital<br>
      currency and payments.<br>
      275<br>
      Predictable Issuance<br>
      Less than 21 million bitcoin will be issued, at a predictable rate.<br>
      The list of building blocks is not complete and more are added with each
      new feature<br>
      introduced into bitcoin.<br>
      Applications from Building Blocks<br>
      The building blocks offered by bitcoin are elements of a trust platform
      that can be<br>
      used to compose applications. Here are some examples of applications that
      exist<br>
      today and the building blocks they use:<br>
      Proof-of-Existence (Digital Notary)<br>
      Immutability + Timestamp + Durability. A digital fingerprint can be
      committed<br>
      with a transaction to the blockchain, proving that a document existed
      (Time‐<br>
      stamp) at the time it was recorded. The fingerprint cannot be modified
      ex-post-<br>
      facto (Immutability) and the proof will be stored permanently
      (Durability).<br>
      Kickstarter (Lighthouse)<br>
      Consistency + Atomicity + Integrity. If you sign one input and the output
      (Integ‐<br>
      rity) of a fundraiser transaction, others can contribute to the fundraiser
      but it<br>
      cannot be spent (Atomicity) until the goal (output value) is funded
      (Consis‐<br>
      tency).<br>
      Payment Channels<br>
      Quorum of Control + Timelock + No Double Spend + Nonexpiration + Censor‐<br>
      ship Resistance + Authorization. A multisig 2-of-2 (Quorum) with a
      timelock<br>
      (Timelock) used as the “settlement” transaction of a payment channel can
      be held<br>
      (Nonexpiration) and spent whenever (Censorship Resistance) by either party<br>
      (Authorization). The two parties can then create commitment transactions
      that<br>
      double-spend (No Double-Spend) the settlement on a shorter timelock (Time‐<br>
      lock).<br>
      Colored Coins<br>
      The first blockchain application we will discuss is colored coins.<br>
      Colored coins refers to a set of similar technologies that use bitcoin
      transactions to<br>
      record the creation, ownership, and transfer of extrinsic assets other
      than bitcoin. By<br>
      “extrinsic” we mean assets that are not stored directly on the bitcoin
      blockchain, as<br>
      opposed to bitcoin itself, which is an asset intrinsic to the blockchain.<br>
      Colored coins are used to track digital assets as well as physical assets
      held by third<br>
      parties and traded through colored coins certificates of ownership.
      Digital asset col‐<br>
      ored coins can represent intangible assets such as a stock certificate,
      license, virtual<br>
      278<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 12: Blockchain Applications<br>
      property (game items), or most any form of licensed intellectual property
      (trade‐<br>
      marks, copyrights, etc.). Tangible asset colored coins can represent
      certificates of<br>
      ownership of commodities (gold, silver, oil), land title, automobiles,
      boats, aircraft,<br>
      etc.<br>
      The term derives from the idea of “coloring” or marking a nominal amount
      of bit‐<br>
      coin, for example, a single satoshi, to represent something other than the
      bitcoin<br>
      value itself. As an analogy, consider stamping a $1 note with a message
      saying, “this is<br>
      a stock certificate of ACME” or “this note can be redeemed for 1 oz of
      silver” and<br>
      then trading the $1 note as a certificate of ownership of this other
      asset. The first<br>
      implementation of colored coins, named Enhanced Padded-Order-Based
      Coloring or<br>
      EPOBC, assigned extrinsic assets to a 1-satoshi output. In this way, it
      was a true “col‐<br>
      ored coin,” as each asset was added as an attribute (color) of a single
      satoshi.<br>
      More recent implementations of colored coins use the OP_RETURN script
      opcode to<br>
      store metadata in a transaction, in conjunction with external data stores
      that associate<br>
      the metadata to specific assets.<br>
      The two most prominent implementations of colored coins today are Open
      Assets and<br>
      Colored Coins by Colu. These two systems use different approaches to
      colored coins<br>
      and are not compatible. Colored coins created in one system cannot be seen
      or used<br>
      in the other system.<br>
      Using Colored Coins<br>
      Colored coins are created, transferred, and generally viewed in special
      wallets that<br>
      can interpret the colored coins protocol metadata attached to bitcoin
      transactions.<br>
      Special care must be taken to avoid using a colored-coin–related key in a
      regular bit‐<br>
      coin wallet, as the regular wallet may destroy the metadata. Similarly,
      colored coins<br>
      should not be sent to addresses managed by regular wallets, but only to
      addresses that<br>
      are managed by wallets that are colored-coin-aware. Both Colu and Open
      Assets sys‐<br>
      tems use special colored-coin addresses to mitigate this risk and to
      ensure that col‐<br>
      ored coins are not sent to unaware wallets.<br>
      Colored coins are also not visible to most general-purpose blockchain
      explorers.<br>
      Instead, you must use a colored-coins explorer to interpret the metadata
      of a colored<br>
      coins transaction.<br>
      An Open Assets-compatible wallet application and blockchain explorer can
      be found<br>
      at coinprism.<br>

      can be<br>

      &nbsp;279<br>
      Issuing Colored Coins<br>
      Each of the colored coins implementations has a different way of creating
      colored<br>
      coins, but they all provide similar functionality. The process of creating
      a colored<br>
      coin asset is called issuance. An initial transaction, the issuance
      transaction registers<br>
      the asset on the bitcoin blockchain and creates an asset ID that is used
      to reference<br>
      the asset. Once issued, assets can be transferred between addresses using
      transfer<br>
      transactions.<br>
      Assets issued as colored coins can have multiple properties. They can be
      divisible or<br>
      indivisible, meaning that the amount of asset in a transfer can be an
      integer (e.g., 5) or<br>
      have decimal subdivision (e.g., 4.321). Assets can also have fixed
      issuance, meaning a<br>
      certain amount are issued only once, or can be reissued, meaning that new
      units of<br>
      the asset can be issued by the original issuer after the initial issuance.<br>
      Finally, some colored coins enable dividends, allowing the distribution of
      bitcoin pay‐<br>
      ments to the owners of a colored coin asset in proportion to their
      ownership.<br>
      Colored Coins Transactions<br>
      The metadata that gives meaning to a colored coin transaction is usually
      stored in<br>
      one of the outputs using the OP_RETURN opcode. Different colored coins
      protocols use<br>
      different encodings for the content of the OP_RETURN data. The output
      containing the<br>
      OP_RETURN is called the marker output.<br>
      The order of the outputs and position of the marker output may have
      special mean‐<br>
      ing in the colored coins protocol. In Open Assets, for example, any
      outputs before the<br>
      marker output represent asset issuance. Any outputs after the marker
      represent asset<br>
      transfer. The marker output assigns specific values and colors to the
      other outputs by<br>
      referencing their order in the transaction.<br>
      In Colored Coins (Colu), by comparison, the marker output encodes an
      opcode that<br>
      determines how the metadata is interpreted. Opcodes 0x01 through 0x0F
      indicate an<br>
      issuance transaction. An issuance opcode is usually followed by an asset
      ID or other<br>
      identifier that can be used to retrieve the asset information from an
      external source<br>
      (e.g., bittorrent). Opcodes 0x10 through 0x1F represent a transfer
      transaction. Trans‐<br>
      fer transaction metadata contain simple scripts that transfer specific
      amounts of<br>
      assets from inputs to outputs, by reference to their index. Ordering of
      inputs and out‐<br>
      puts is therefore important in the interpretation of the script.<br>
      If the metadata is too long to fit in OP_RETURN, the colored coins
      protocol may use<br>
      other “tricks” to store metadata in a transaction. Examples include
      putting metadata<br>
      in a redeem script, followed by OP_DROP opcodes to ensure the script
      ignores the<br>
      metadata. Another mechanism used is a 1-of-N multisig script where only
      the first<br>

      &nbsp;Chapter 12: Blockchain Applications<br>
      public key is a real public key that can spend the output and subsequent
      “keys” are<br>
      replaced by encoded metadata.<br>
      In order to correctly interpret the metadata in a colored coins
      transaction you must<br>
      use a compatible wallet or block explorer. Otherwise, the transaction
      looks like a<br>
      “normal” bitcoin transaction with an OP_RETURN output.<br>
      As an example, I created and issued a MasterBTC asset using colored coins.
      The Mas‐<br>
      terBTC asset represents a voucher for a free copy of this book. These
      vouchers can be<br>
      transferred, traded, and redeemed using a colored coins-compatible wallet.<br>
      For this particular example, I used the wallet and explorer at
      https://coinprism.info,<br>
      which uses the Open Assets colored coins protocol.<br>

      Counterparty<br>
      Counterparty is a protocol layer built on top of bitcoin. The Counterparty
      protocol,<br>
      similar to colored coins, offers the ability to create and trade virtual
      assets and tokens.<br>
      In addition, Counterparty offers a decentralized exchange for assets.
      Counterparty is<br>
      also implementing smart contracts, based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine
      (EVM).<br>
      Like the colored coins protocols, Counterparty embeds metadata in bitcoin
      transac‐<br>
      tions, using the OP_RETURN opcode or 1-of-N multisignature addresses that
      encode<br>
      metadata in the place of public keys. Using these mechanisms, Counterparty
      imple‐<br>
      ments a protocol layer encoded in bitcoin transactions. The additional
      protocol layer<br>
      can be interpreted by applications that are Counterparty-aware, such as
      wallets and<br>
      blockchain explorers, or any application built using the Counterparty
      libraries.<br>
      Counterparty<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;283<br>
      Counterparty can be used as a platform for other applications and
      services, in turn.<br>
      For example, Tokenly is a platform built on top of Counterparty that
      allows content<br>
      creators, artists, and companies to issue tokens that express digital
      ownership and can<br>
      be used to rent, access, trade, or shop for content, products, and
      services. Other appli‐<br>
      cations leveraging Counterparty include games (Spells of Genesis) and grid
      comput‐<br>
      ing projects (Folding Coin).<br>

      Payment Channels and State Channels<br>
      Payment channels are a trustless mechanism for exchanging bitcoin
      transactions<br>
      between two parties, outside of the bitcoin blockchain. These
      transactions, which<br>
      would be valid if settled on the bitcoin blockchain, are held off-chain
      instead, acting<br>
      as promissory notes for eventual batch settlement. Because the
      transactions are not<br>
      settled, they can be exchanged without the usual settlement latency,
      allowing<br>
      extremely high transaction throughput, low (submillisecond) latency, and
      fine<br>
      (satoshi-level) granularity.<br>
      Actually, the term channel is a metaphor. State channels are virtual
      constructs repre‐<br>
      sented by the exchange of state between two parties, outside of the
      blockchain. There<br>
      are no “channels” per se and the underlying data transport mechanism is
      not the<br>
      channel. We use the term channel to represent the relationship and shared
      state<br>
      between two parties, outside of the blockchain.<br>
      To further explain this concept, think of a TCP stream. From the
      perspective of<br>
      higher-level protocols it is a “socket” connecting two applications across
      the internet.<br>
      But if you look at the network traffic, a TCP stream is just a virtual
      channel over IP<br>
      packets. Each endpoint of the TCP stream sequences and assembles IP
      packets to cre‐<br>
      ate the illusion of a stream of bytes. Underneath, it’s all disconnected
      packets. Simi‐<br>
      larly, a payment channel is just a series of transactions. If properly
      sequenced and<br>
      connected, they create redeemable obligations that you can trust even
      though you<br>
      don’t trust the other side of the channel.<br>
      In this section we will look at various forms of payment channels. First,
      we will exam‐<br>
      ine the mechanisms used to construct a one-way (unidirectional) payment
      channel<br>
      for a metered micropayment service, such as streaming video. Then, we will
      expand<br>
      on this mechanism and introduce bidirectional payment channels. Finally,
      we will<br>
      look at how bidirectional channels can be connected end-to-end to form
      multihop<br>
      channels in a routed network, first proposed under the name Lightning
      Network.<br>
      Payment channels are part of the broader concept of a state channel, which
      represents<br>
      an off-chain alteration of state, secured by eventual settlement in a
      blockchain. A pay‐<br>
      284<br>
      &nbsp;| Chapter 12: Blockchain Applications<br>
      ment channel is a state channel where the state being altered is the
      balance of a virtual<br>
      currency.<br>
      State Channels—Basic Concepts and Terminology<br>
      A state channel is established between two parties, through a transaction
      that locks a<br>
      shared state on the blockchain. This is called the funding transaction or
      anchor trans‐<br>
      action. This single transaction must be transmitted to the network and
      mined to<br>
      establish the channel. In the example of a payment channel, the locked
      state is the<br>
      initial balance (in currency) of the channel.<br>
      The two parties then exchange signed transactions, called commitment
      transactions,<br>
      that alter the initial state. These transactions are valid transactions in
      that they could<br>
      be submitted for settlement by either party, but instead are held
      off-chain by each<br>
      party pending the channel closure. State updates can be created as fast as
      each party<br>
      can create, sign, and transmit a transaction to the other party. In
      practice this means<br>
      that thousands of transactions per second can be exchanged.<br>
      When exchanging commitment transactions the two parties also invalidate
      the previ‐<br>
      ous states, so that the most up-to-date commitment transaction is always
      the only one<br>
      that can be redeemed. This prevents either party from cheating by
      unilaterally closing<br>
      the channel with an expired prior state that is more favorable to them
      than the cur‐<br>
      rent state. We will examine the various mechanisms that can be used to
      invalidate<br>
      prior state in the rest of this chapter.<br>
      Finally, the channel can be closed either cooperatively, by submitting a
      final settle‐<br>
      ment transaction to the blockchain, or unilaterally, by either party
      submitting the last<br>
      commitment transaction to the blockchain. A unilateral close option is
      needed in<br>
      case one of the parties unexpectedly disconnects. The settlement
      transaction repre‐<br>
      sents the final state of the channel and is settled on the blockchain.<br>
      In the entire lifetime of the channel, only two transactions need to be
      submitted for<br>
      mining on the blockchain: the funding and settlement transactions. In
      between these<br>
      two states, the two parties can exchange any number of commitment
      transactions<br>
      that are never seen by anyone else, nor submitted to the blockchain.<br>

      Simple Payment Channel Example<br>
      To explain state channels, we have to start with a very simple example. We
      demon‐<br>
      strate a one-way channel, meaning that value is flowing in one direction
      only. We will<br>
      also start with the naive assumption that no one is trying to cheat, to
      keep things sim‐<br>
      ple. Once we have the basic channel idea explained, we will then look at
      what it takes<br>
      to make it trustless so that neither party can cheat, even if they are
      trying to.<br>
      286<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 12: Blockchain Applications<br>
      For this example we will assume two participants: Emma and Fabian. Fabian
      offers a<br>
      video streaming service that is billed by the second using a micropayment
      channel.<br>
      Fabian charges 0.01 millibit (0.00001 BTC) per second of video, equivalent
      to 36 mil‐<br>
      libits (0.036 BTC) per hour of video. Emma is a user who purchases this
      streaming<br>
      video service from Fabian. Figure 12-5 shows Emma buying the video
      streaming ser‐<br>
      vice from Fabian using a payment channel.<br>
      Figure 12-5. Emma purchases streaming video from Fabian with a payment
      channel,<br>
      paying for each second of video<br>
      In this example, Fabian and Emma are using special software that handles
      both the<br>
      payment channel and the video streaming. Emma is running the software in
      her<br>
      browser, Fabian is running it on a server. The software includes basic
      bitcoin wallet<br>
      functionality and can create and sign bitcoin transactions. Both the
      concept and the<br>
      term “payment channel” are completely hidden from the users. What they see
      is video<br>
      that is paid for by the second.<br>
      To set up the payment channel, Emma and Fabian establish a 2-of-2
      multisignature<br>
      address, with each of them holding one of the keys. From Emma’s
      perspective, the<br>
      software in her browser presents a QR code with a P2SH address (starting
      with “3”),<br>
      and asks her to submit a “deposit” for up to 1 hour of video. The address
      is then fun‐<br>
      ded by Emma. Emma’s transaction, paying to the multisignature address, is
      the fund‐<br>
      ing or anchor transaction for the payment channel.<br>
      For this example, let’s say that Emma funds the channel with 36 millibits
      (0.036 BTC).<br>
      This will allow Emma to consume up to 1 hour of streaming video. The
      funding<br>
      transaction in this case sets the maximum amount that can be transmitted
      in this<br>
      channel, setting the channel capacity.<br>
      The funding transaction consumes one or more inputs from Emma’s wallet,
      sourcing<br>
      the funds. It creates one output with a value of 36 millibits paid to the
      multisignature<br>
      Payment Channels and State Channels<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;287<br>
      2-of-2 address controlled jointly between Emma and Fabian. It may have
      additional<br>
      outputs for change back to Emma’s wallet.<br>
      Once the funding transaction is confirmed, Emma can start streaming video.
      Emma’s<br>
      software creates and signs a commitment transaction that changes the
      channel bal‐<br>
      ance to credit 0.01 millibit to Fabian’s address and refund 35.99
      millibits back to<br>
      Emma. The transaction signed by Emma consumes the 36 millibits output
      created by<br>
      the funding transaction and creates two outputs: one for her refund, the
      other for<br>
      Fabian’s payment. The transaction is only partially signed—it requires two
      signatures<br>
      (2-of-2), but only has Emma’s signature. When Fabian’s server receives
      this transac‐<br>
      tion, it adds the second signature (for the 2-of-2 input) and returns it
      to Emma<br>
      together with 1 second worth of video. Now both parties have a fully
      signed commit‐<br>
      ment transaction that either can redeem, representing the correct
      up-to-date balance<br>
      of the channel. Neither party broadcasts this transaction to the network.<br>
      In the next round, Emma’s software creates and signs another commitment
      transac‐<br>
      tion (commitment #2) that consumes the same 2-of-2 output from the funding
      trans‐<br>
      action. The second commitment transaction allocates one output of 0.2
      millibits to<br>
      Fabian’s address and one output of 35.98 millibits back to Emma’s address.
      This new<br>
      transaction is payment for two cumulative seconds of video. Fabian’s
      software signs<br>
      and returns the second commitment transaction, together with the another
      second of<br>
      video.<br>
      In this way, Emma’s software continues to send commitment transactions to
      Fabian’s<br>
      server in exchange for streaming video. The balance of the channel
      gradually accu‐<br>
      mulates in favor of Fabian, as Emma consumes more seconds of video. Let’s
      say<br>
      Emma watches 600 seconds (10 minutes) of video, creating and signing 600
      commit‐<br>
      ment transactions. The last commitment transaction (#600) will have two
      outputs,<br>
      splitting the balance of the channel, 6 millibits to Fabian and 30
      millibits to Emma.<br>
      Finally, Emma clicks “Stop” to stop streaming video. Either Fabian or Emma
      can now<br>
      transmit the final state transaction for settlement. This last transaction
      is the settle‐<br>
      ment transaction and pays Fabian for all the video Emma consumed,
      refunding the<br>
      remainder of the funding transaction to Emma.<br>
      Figure 12-6 shows the channel between Emma and Fabian and the commitment<br>
      transactions that update the balance of the channel.<br>
      In the end, only two transactions are recorded on the blockchain: the
      funding trans‐<br>
      action that established the channel and a settlement transaction that
      allocated the<br>
      final balance correctly between the two participants.<br>

      Making Trustless Channels<br>
      The channel we just described works, but only if both parties cooperate,
      without any<br>
      failures or attempts to cheat. Let’s look at some of the scenarios that
      break this chan‐<br>
      nel and see what is needed to fix those:<br>
      • Once the funding transaction happens, Emma needs Fabian’s signature to
      get any<br>
      money back. If Fabian disappears, Emma’s funds are locked in a 2-of-2 and
      effec‐<br>
      tively lost. This channel, as constructed, leads to a loss of funds if one
      of the par‐<br>
      ties disconnects before there is at least one commitment transaction
      signed by<br>
      both parties.<br>
      • While the channel is running, Emma can take any of the commitment
      transac‐<br>
      tions Fabian has countersigned and transmit one to the blockchain. Why pay

      pay for 1 second of video? The channel fails because Emma can cheat by
      broad‐<br>
      casting a prior commitment that is in her favor.<br>
      Both of these problems can be solved with timelocks—let’s look at how we
      could use<br>
      transaction-level timelocks (nLocktime).<br>
      Emma cannot risk funding a 2-of-2 multisig unless she has a guaranteed
      refund. To<br>
      solve this problem, Emma constructs the funding and refund transaction at
      the same<br>
      time. She signs the funding transaction but doesn’t transmit it to anyone.
      Emma<br>
      transmits only the refund transaction to Fabian and obtains his signature.<br>
      The refund transaction acts as the first commitment transaction and its
      timelock<br>
      establishes the upper bound for the channel’s life. In this case, Emma
      could set the<br>
      nLocktime to 30 days or 4320 blocks into the future. All subsequent
      commitment<br>
      transactions must have a shorter timelock, so that they can be redeemed
      before the<br>
      refund transaction.<br>
      Now that Emma has a fully signed refund transaction, she can confidently
      transmit<br>
      the signed funding transaction knowing that she can eventually, after the
      timelock<br>
      expires, redeem the refund transaction even if Fabian disappears.<br>
      Every commitment transaction the parties exchange during the life of the
      channel<br>
      will be timelocked into the future. But the delay will be slightly shorter
      for each com‐<br>
      mitment so the most recent commitment can be redeemed before the prior
      commit‐<br>
      ment it invalidates. Because of the nLockTime, neither party can
      successfully<br>
      propagate any of the commitment transactions until their timelock expires.
      If all goes<br>
      well, they will cooperate and close the channel gracefully with a
      settlement transac‐<br>
      tion, making it unnecessary to transmit an intermediate commitment
      transaction. If<br>
      not, the most recent commitment transaction can be propagated to settle
      the account<br>
      and invalidate all prior commitment transactions.<br>
      For example, if commitment transaction #1 is timelocked to 4320 blocks in
      the<br>
      future, then commitment transaction #2 is timelocked to 4319 blocks in the
      future.<br>
      Commitment transaction #600 can be spent 600 blocks before commitment
      transac‐<br>
      tion #1 becomes valid.<br>
      Figure 12-7 shows each commitment transaction setting a shorter timelock,
      allowing<br>
      it to be spent before the previous commitments become valid.<br>

      Figure 12-7. Each commitment sets a shorter timelock, allowing it to be
      spent before the<br>
      previous commitments become valid<br>
      Each subsequent commitment transaction must have a shorter timelock so
      that it<br>
      may be broadcast before its predecessors and before the refund
      transaction. The abil‐<br>
      ity to broadcast a commitment earlier ensures it will be able to spend the
      funding<br>
      output and preclude any other commitment transaction from being redeemed
      by<br>
      spending the output. The guarantees offered by the bitcoin blockchain,
      preventing<br>
      double-spends and enforcing timelocks, effectively allow each commitment
      transac‐<br>
      tion to invalidate its predecessors.<br>
      State channels use timelocks to enforce smart contracts across a time
      dimension. In<br>
      this example we saw how the time dimension guarantees that the most recent
      com‐<br>
      mitment transaction becomes valid before any earlier commitments. Thus,
      the most<br>
      recent commitment transaction can be transmitted, spending the inputs and
      invalid‐<br>
      ating prior commitment transactions. The enforcement of smart contracts
      with abso‐<br>
      lute timelocks protects against cheating by one of the parties. This
      implementation<br>
      needs nothing more than absolute transaction-level timelocks (nLocktime).
      Next, we<br>
      will see how script-level timelocks, CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and
      CHECKSEQUENCEVER<br>
      IFY, can be used to construct more flexible, useful, and sophisticated
      state channels.<br>
      The first form of unidirectional payment channel was demonstrated as a
      prototype<br>
      video streaming application in 2015 by an Argentinian team of developers.
      You can<br>
      still see it at streamium.io.<br>
      Timelocks are not the only way to invalidate prior commitment
      transactions. In the<br>
      next sections we will see how a revocation key can be used to achieve the
      same result.<br>
      Timelocks are effective but they have two distinct disadvantages. By
      establishing a<br>
      maximum timelock when the channel is first opened, they limit the lifetime
      of the<br>
      channel. Worse, they force channel implementations to strike a balance
      between<br>
      allowing long-lived channels and forcing one of the participants to wait a
      very long<br>
      time for a refund in case of premature closure. For example, if you allow
      the channel<br>
      to remain open for 30 days, by setting the refund timelock to 30 days, if
      one of the<br>
      Payment Channels and State Channels<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;291<br>
      parties disappears immediately the other party must wait 30 days for a
      refund. The<br>
      more distant the endpoint, the more distant the refund.<br>
      The second problem is that since each subsequent commitment transaction
      must<br>
      decrement the timelock, there is an explicit limit on the number of
      commitment<br>
      transactions that can be exchanged between the parties. For example, a
      30-day chan‐<br>
      nel, setting a timelock of 4320 blocks into the future, can only
      accommodate 4320<br>
      intermediate commitment transactions before it must be closed. There is a
      danger in<br>
      setting the timelock commitment transaction interval at 1 block. By
      setting the time‐<br>
      lock interval between commitment transactions to 1 block, a developer is
      creating a<br>
      very high burden for the channel participants who have to be vigilant,
      remain online<br>
      and watching, and be ready to transmit the right commitment transaction at
      anytime.<br>
      Now that we understand how timelocks can be used to invalidate prior
      commitments,<br>
      we can see the difference between closing the channel cooperatively and
      closing it<br>
      unilaterally by broadcasting a commitment transaction. All commitment
      transactions<br>
      are timelocked, therefore broadcasting a commitment transaction will
      always involve<br>
      waiting until the timelock has expired. But if the two parties agree on
      what the final<br>
      balance is and know they both hold commitment transactions that will
      eventually<br>
      make that balance a reality, they can construct a settlement transaction
      without a<br>
      timelock representing that same balance. In a cooperative close, either
      party takes the<br>
      most recent commitment transaction and builds a settlement transaction
      that is iden‐<br>
      tical in every way except that it omits the timelock. Both parties can
      sign this settle‐<br>
      ment transaction knowing there is no way to cheat and get a more favorable
      balance.<br>
      By cooperatively signing and transmitting the settlement transaction they
      can close<br>
      the channel and redeem their balance immediately. Worst case, one of the
      parties can<br>
      be petty, refuse to cooperate, and force the other party to do a
      unilateral close with<br>
      the most recent commitment transaction. But if they do that, they have to
      wait for<br>
      their funds too.<br>
      Asymmetric Revocable Commitments<br>
      A better way to handle the prior commitment states is to explicitly revoke
      them.<br>
      However, this is not easy to achieve. A key characteristic of bitcoin is
      that once a<br>
      transaction is valid, it remains valid and does not expire. The only way
      to cancel a<br>
      transaction is by double-spending its inputs with another transaction
      before it is<br>
      mined. That’s why we used timelocks in the simple payment channel example
      above<br>
      to ensure that more recent commitments could be spent before older
      commitments<br>
      were valid. However, sequencing commitments in time creates a number of
      con‐<br>
      straints that make payment channels difficult to use.<br>
      Even though a transaction cannot be canceled, it can be constructed in
      such a way as<br>
      to make it undesirable to use. The way we do that is by giving each party
      a revocation<br>
      key that can be used to punish the other party if they try to cheat. This
      mechanism for<br>
      292<br>
      &nbsp;| Chapter 12: Blockchain Applications<br>
      revoking prior commitment transactions was first proposed as part of the
      Lightning<br>
      Network.<br>
      To explain revocation keys, we will construct a more complex payment
      channel<br>
      between two exchanges run by Hitesh and Irene. Hitesh and Irene run
      bitcoin<br>
      exchanges in India and the USA, respectively. Customers of Hitesh’s Indian
      exchange<br>
      often send payments to customers of Irene’s USA exchange and vice versa.
      Currently,<br>
      these transactions occur on the bitcoin blockchain, but this means paying
      fees and<br>
      waiting several blocks for confirmations. Setting up a payment channel
      between the<br>
      exchanges will significantly reduce the cost and accelerate the
      transaction flow.<br>
      Hitesh and Irene start the channel by collaboratively constructing a
      funding transac‐<br>
      tion, each funding the channel with 5 bitcoin. The initial balance is 5
      bitcoin for<br>
      Hitesh and 5 bitcoin for Irene. The funding transaction locks the channel
      state in a 2-<br>
      of-2 multisig, just like in the example of a simple channel.<br>
      The funding transaction may have one or more inputs from Hitesh (adding up
      to 5<br>
      bitcoin or more), and one or more inputs from Irene (adding up to 5
      bitcoin or<br>
      more). The inputs have to slightly exceed the channel capacity in order to
      cover the<br>
      transaction fees. The transaction has one output that locks the 10 total
      bitcoin to a 2-<br>
      of-2 multisig address controlled by both Hitesh and Irene. The funding
      transaction<br>
      may also have one or more outputs returning change to Hitesh and Irene if
      their<br>
      inputs exceeded their intended channel contribution. This is a single
      transaction with<br>
      inputs offered and signed by two parties. It has to be constructed in
      collaboration and<br>
      signed by each party before it is transmitted.<br>
      Now, instead of creating a single commitment transaction that both parties
      sign,<br>
      Hitesh and Irene create two different commitment transactions that are
      asymmetric.<br>
      Hitesh has a commitment transaction with two outputs. The first output
      pays Irene<br>
      the 5 bitcoin she is owed immediately. The second output pays Hitesh the 5
      bitcoin he<br>
      is owed, but only after a timelock of 1000 blocks. The transaction outputs
      look like<br>
      this:<br>
      Input: 2-of-2 funding output, signed by Irene<br>
      Output 0 &lt;5 bitcoin&gt;:<br>
      &lt;Irene's Public Key&gt; CHECKSIG<br>
      Output 1:<br>
      &lt;1000 blocks&gt;<br>
      CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY<br>
      DROP<br>
      &lt;Hitesh's Public Key&gt; CHECKSIG<br>
      Irene has a different commitment transaction with two outputs. The first
      output pays<br>
      Hitesh the 5 bitcoin he is owed immediately. The second output pays Irene
      the 5 bit‐<br>
      Payment Channels and State Channels<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;293<br>
      coin she is owed but only after a timelock of 1000 blocks. The commitment
      transac‐<br>
      tion Irene holds (signed by Hitesh) looks like this:<br>
      Input: 2-of-2 funding output, signed by Hitesh<br>
      Output 0 &lt;5 bitcoin&gt;:<br>
      &lt;Hitesh's Public Key&gt; CHECKSIG<br>
      Output 1:<br>
      &lt;1000 blocks&gt;<br>
      CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY<br>
      DROP<br>
      &lt;Irene's Public Key&gt; CHECKSIG<br>
      This way, each party has a commitment transaction, spending the 2-of-2
      funding out‐<br>
      put. This input is signed by the other party. At any time the party
      holding the transac‐<br>
      tion can also sign (completing the 2-of-2) and broadcast. However, if they
      broadcast<br>
      the commitment transaction, it pays the other party immediately whereas
      they have<br>
      to wait for a short timelock to expire. By imposing a delay on the
      redemption of one<br>
      of the outputs, we put each party at a slight disadvantage when they
      choose to unilat‐<br>
      erally broadcast a commitment transaction. But a time delay alone isn’t
      enough to<br>
      encourage fair conduct.<br>
      Figure 12-8 shows two asymmetric commitment transactions, where the output
      pay‐<br>
      ing the holder of the commitment is delayed.<br>
      Figure 12-8. Two asymmetric commitment transactions with delayed payment
      for the<br>
      party holding the transaction<br>
      Now we introduce the final element of this scheme: a revocation key that
      allows a<br>
      wronged party to punish a cheater by taking the entire balance of the
      channel.<br>
      294<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 12: Blockchain Applications<br>
      Each of the commitment transactions has a “delayed” output. The redemption
      script<br>
      for that output allows one party to redeem it after 1000 blocks or the
      other party to<br>
      redeem it if they have a revocation key. So when Hitesh creates a
      commitment trans‐<br>
      action for Irene to sign, he makes the second output payable to himself
      after 1000<br>
      blocks, or to whoever can present a revocation key. Hitesh constructs this
      transaction<br>
      and creates a revocation key that he keeps secret. He will only reveal it
      to Irene when<br>
      he is ready to move to a new channel state and wants to revoke this
      commitment. The<br>
      second output’s script looks like this:<br>
      Output 0 &lt;5 bitcoin&gt;:<br>
      &lt;Irene's Public Key&gt; CHECKSIG<br>
      Output 1 &lt;5 bitcoin&gt;:<br>
      IF<br>
      # Revocation penalty output<br>
      &lt;Revocation Public Key&gt;<br>
      ELSE<br>
      &lt;1000 blocks&gt;<br>
      CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY<br>
      DROP<br>
      &lt;Hitesh's Public Key&gt;<br>
      ENDIF<br>
      CHECKSIG<br>
      Irene can confidently sign this transaction, since if transmitted it will
      immediately<br>
      pay her what she is owed. Hitesh holds the transaction, but knows that if
      he transmits<br>
      it in a unilateral channel closing, he will have to wait 1000 blocks to
      get paid.<br>
      When the channel is advanced to the next state, Hitesh has to revoke this
      commit‐<br>
      ment transaction before Irene agrees to sign the next commitment
      transaction. To do<br>
      that, all he has to do is send the revocation key to Irene. Once Irene has
      the revocation<br>
      key for this commitment, she can sign the next commitment with confidence.
      She<br>
      knows that if Hitesh tries to cheat by publishing the prior commitment,
      she can use<br>
      the revocation key to redeem Hitesh’s delayed output. If Hitesh cheats,
      Irene gets<br>
      BOTH outputs.<br>
      The revocation protocol is bilateral, meaning that in each round, as the
      channel state<br>
      is advanced, the two parties exchange new commitments, exchange revocation
      keys<br>
      for the previous commitment, and sign each other’s commitment
      transactions. As<br>
      they accept a new state, they make the prior state impossible to use, by
      giving each<br>
      other the necessary revocation keys to punish any cheating.<br>
      Let’s look at an example of how it works. One of Irene’s customers wants
      to send 2<br>
      bitcoin to one of Hitesh’s customers. To transmit 2 bitcoin across the
      channel, Hitesh<br>
      and Irene must advance the channel state to reflect the new balance. They
      will com‐<br>
      mit to a new state (state number 2) where the channel’s 10 bitcoin are
      split, 7 bitcoin<br>
      to Hitesh and 3 bitcoin to Irene. To advance the state of the channel,
      they will each<br>
      create new commitment transactions reflecting the new channel balance.<br>
      Payment Channels and State Channels<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;295<br>
      As before, these commitment transactions are asymmetric so that the
      commitment<br>
      transaction each party holds forces them to wait if they redeem it.
      Crucially, before<br>
      signing new commitment transactions, they must first exchange revocation
      keys to<br>
      invalidate the prior commitment. In this particular case, Hitesh’s
      interests are aligned<br>
      with the real state of the channel and therefore he has no reason to
      broadcast a prior<br>
      state. However, for Irene, state number 1 leaves her with a higher balance
      than state 2.<br>
      When Irene gives Hitesh the revocation key for her prior commitment
      transaction<br>
      (state number 1) she is effectively revoking her ability to profit from
      regressing the<br>
      channel to a prior state because with the revocation key, Hitesh can
      redeem both out‐<br>
      puts of the prior commitment transaction without delay. Meaning if Irene
      broadcasts<br>
      the prior state, Hitesh can exercise his right to take all of the outputs.<br>
      Importantly, the revocation doesn’t happen automatically. While Hitesh has
      the abil‐<br>
      ity to punish Irene for cheating, he has to watch the blockchain
      diligently for signs of<br>
      cheating. If he sees a prior commitment transaction broadcast, he has 1000
      blocks to<br>
      take action and use the revocation key to thwart Irene’s cheating and
      punish her by<br>
      taking the entire balance, all 10 bitcoin.<br>
      Asymmetric revocable commitments with relative time locks (CSV) are a much
      better<br>
      way to implement payment channels and a very significant innovation in
      this tech‐<br>
      nology. With this construct, the channel can remain open indefinitely and
      can have<br>
      billions of intermediate commitment transactions. In prototype
      implementations of<br>
      Lightning Network, the commitment state is identified by a 48-bit index,
      allowing<br>
      more than 281 trillion (2.8 x 1014) state transitions in any single
      channel!<br>
      Hash Time Lock Contracts (HTLC)<br>
      Payment channels can be further extended with a special type of smart
      contract that<br>
      allows the participants to commit funds to a redeemable secret, with an
      expiration<br>
      time. This feature is called a Hash Time Lock Contract, or HTLC, and is
      used in both<br>
      bidirectional and routed payment channels.<br>
      Let’s first explain the “hash” part of the HTLC. To create an HTLC, the
      intended<br>
      recipient of the payment will first create a secret R. They then calculate
      the hash of<br>
      this secret H:<br>
      H = Hash(R)<br>
      This produces a hash H that can be included in an output’s locking script.
      Whoever<br>
      knows the secret can use it to redeem the output. The secret R is also
      referred to as a<br>
      preimage to the hash function. The preimage is just the data that is used
      as input to a<br>
      hash function.<br>
      The second part of an HTLC is the “time lock” component. If the secret is
      not<br>
      revealed, the payer of the HTLC can get a “refund” after some time. This
      is achieved<br>
      with an absolute time lock using CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.<br>
      296<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 12: Blockchain Applications<br>
      The script implementing an HTLC might look like this:<br>
      IF<br>
      # Payment if you have the secret R<br>
      HASH160 &lt;H&gt; EQUALVERIFY<br>
      ELSE<br>
      # Refund after timeout.<br>
      &lt;locktime&gt; CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP<br>
      &lt;Payee Pubic Key&gt; CHECKSIG<br>
      ENDIF<br>
      Anyone who knows the secret R, which when hashed equals to H, can redeem
      this out‐<br>
      put by exercising the first clause of the IF flow.<br>
      If the secret is not revealed and the HTLC claimed, after a certain number
      of blocks<br>
      the payee can claim a refund using the second clause in the IF flow.<br>
      This is a basic implementation of an HTLC. This type of HTLC can be
      redeemed by<br>
      anyone who has the secret R. An HTLC can take many different forms with
      slight var‐<br>
      iations to the script. For example, adding a CHECKSIG operator and a
      public key in the<br>
      first clause restricts redemption of the hash to a named recipient, who
      must also<br>
      know the secret R.<br>
      Routed Payment Channels (Lightning Network)<br>
      The Lightning Network is a proposed routed network of bidirectional
      payment chan‐<br>
      nels connected end-to-end. A network like this can allow any participant
      to route a<br>
      payment from channel to channel without trusting any of the
      intermediaries. The<br>
      Lightning Network was first described by Joseph Poon and Thadeus Dryja in
      Febru‐<br>
      ary 2015, building on the concept of payment channels as proposed and
      elaborated<br>
      upon by many others.<br>
      “Lightning Network” refers to a specific design for a routed payment
      channel net‐<br>
      work, which has now been implemented by at least five different open
      source teams.<br>
      The independent implementations are coordinated by a set of
      interoperability stand‐<br>
      ards described in the Basics of Lightning Technology (BOLT) paper.<br>
      Prototype implementations of the Lightning Network have been released by
      several<br>
      teams. For now, these implementations can only be run on testnet because
      they use<br>
      segwit, which is not activated on the main bitcoin blockchain (mainnet).<br>
      The Lightning Network is one possible way of implementing routed payment
      chan‐<br>
      nels. There are several other designs that aim to achieve similar goals,
      such as Tee‐<br>
      chan and Tumblebit.<br>

      &nbsp;297<br>
      Basic Lightning Network Example<br>
      Let’s see how this works.<br>
      In this example, we have five participants: Alice, Bob, Carol, Diana, and
      Eric. These<br>
      five participants have opened payment channels with each other, in pairs.
      Alice has a<br>
      payment channel with Bob. Bob is connected to Carol, Carol to Diana, and
      Diana to<br>
      Eric. For simplicity let’s assume each channel is funded with 2 bitcoin by
      each partici‐<br>
      pant, for a total capacity of 4 bitcoin in each channel.<br>
      Figure 12-9 shows five participants in a Lightning Network, connected by
      bidirec‐<br>
      tional payment channels that can be linked to make a payment from Alice to
      Eric<br>
      (“Routed Payment Channels (Lightning Network)” on page 297).<br>
      Figure 12-9. A series of bidirectional payment channels linked to form a
      Lightning Net‐<br>
      work that can route a payment from Alice to Eric<br>
      Alice wants to pay Eric 1 bitcoin. However, Alice is not connected to Eric
      by a pay‐<br>
      ment channel. Creating a payment channel requires a funding transaction,
      which<br>
      must be committed to the bitcoin blockchain. Alice does not want to open a
      new pay‐<br>
      ment channel and commit more of her funds. Is there a way to pay Eric,
      indirectly?<br>
      Figure 12-10 shows the step-by-step process of routing a payment from
      Alice to Eric,<br>
      through a series of HTLC commitments on the payment channels connecting
      the<br>
      participants.<br>

      Figure 12-10. Step-by-step payment routing through a Lightning Network<br>
      Alice is running a Lightning Network (LN) node that is keeping track of
      her payment<br>
      channel to Bob and has the ability to discover routes between payment
      channels. Ali‐<br>
      ce’s LN node also has the ability to connect over the internet to Eric’s
      LN node. Eric’s<br>
      LN node creates a secret R using a random number generator. Eric’s node
      does not<br>
      reveal this secret to anyone. Instead, Eric’s node calculates a hash H of
      the secret R and<br>
      transmits this hash to Alice’s node (see Figure 12-10 step 1).<br>
      Now Alice’s LN node constructs a route between Alice’s LN node and Eric’s
      LN node.<br>
      The routing algorithm used will be examined in more detail later, but for
      now let’s<br>
      assume that Alice’s node can find an efficient route.<br>
      Alice’s node then constructs an HTLC, payable to the hash H, with a
      10-block refund<br>
      timeout (current block + 10), for an amount of 1.003 bitcoin (see Figure
      12-10 step<br>
      2). The extra 0.003 will be used to compensate the intermediate nodes for
      their partic‐<br>
      ipation in this payment route. Alice offers this HTLC to Bob, deducting
      1.003 bitcoin<br>
      from her channel balance with Bob and committing it to the HTLC. The HTLC
      has<br>
      the following meaning: “Alice is committing 1.003 of her channel balance
      to be paid to<br>
      Bob if Bob knows the secret, or refunded back to Alice’s balance if 10
      blocks elapse.” The<br>
      channel balance between Alice and Bob is now expressed by commitment
      transac‐<br>
      tions with three outputs: 2 bitcoin balance to Bob, 0.997 bitcoin balance
      to Alice,<br>
      Routed Payment Channels (Lightning Network)<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;299<br>
      1.003 bitcoin committed in Alice’s HTLC. Alice’s balance is reduced by the
      amount<br>
      committed to the HTLC.<br>
      Bob now has a commitment that if he is able to get the secret R within the
      next 10<br>
      blocks, he can claim the 1.003 locked by Alice. With this commitment in
      hand, Bob’s<br>
      node constructs an HTLC on his payment channel with Carol. Bob’s HTLC
      commits<br>
      1.002 bitcoin to hash H for 9 blocks, which Carol can redeem if she has
      secret R (see<br>
      Figure 12-10 step 3). Bob knows that if Carol can claim his HTLC, she has
      to produce<br>
      R. If Bob has R in nine blocks, he can use it to claim Alice’s HTLC to
      him. He also<br>
      makes 0.001 bitcoin for committing his channel balance for nine blocks. If
      Carol is<br>
      unable to claim his HTLC and he is unable to claim Alice’s HTLC,
      everything reverts<br>
      back to the prior channel balances and no one is at a loss. The channel
      balance<br>
      between Bob and Carol is now: 2 to Carol, 0.998 to Bob, 1.002 committed by
      Bob to<br>
      the HTLC.<br>
      Carol now has a commitment that if she gets R within the next nine blocks,
      she can<br>
      claim 1.002 bitcoin locked by Bob. Now she can make an HTLC commitment on
      her<br>
      channel with Diana. She commits an HTLC of 1.001 bitcoin to hash H, for
      eight<br>
      blocks, which Diana can redeem if she has secret R (see Figure 12-10 step
      4). From<br>
      Carol’s perspective, if this works she is 0.001 bitcoin better off and if
      it doesn’t she<br>
      loses nothing. Her HTLC to Diana is only viable if R is revealed, at which
      point she<br>
      can claim the HTLC from Bob. The channel balance between Carol and Diana
      is<br>
      now: 2 to Diana, 0.999 to Carol, 1.001 committed by Carol to the HTLC.<br>
      Finally, Diana can offer an HTLC to Eric, committing 1 bitcoin for seven
      blocks to<br>
      hash H (see Figure 12-10 step 5). The channel balance between Diana and
      Eric is now:<br>
      2 to Eric, 1 to Diana, 1 committed by Diana to the HTLC.<br>
      However, at this hop in the route, Eric has secret R. He can therefore
      claim the HTLC<br>
      offered by Diana. He sends R to Diana and claims the 1 bitcoin, adding it
      to his chan‐<br>
      nel balance (see Figure 12-10 step 6). The channel balance is now: 1 to
      Diana, 3 to<br>
      Eric.<br>
      Now, Diana has secret R. Therefore, she can now claim the HTLC from Carol.
      Diana<br>
      transmits R to Carol and adds the 1.001 bitcoin to her channel balance
      (see<br>
      Figure 12-10 step 7). Now the channel balance between Carol and Diana is:
      0.999 to<br>
      Carol, 3.001 to Diana. Diana has “earned” 0.001 for participating in this
      payment<br>
      route.<br>
      Flowing back through the route, the secret R allows each participant to
      claim the out‐<br>
      standing HTLCs. Carol claims 1.002 from Bob, setting the balance on their
      channel<br>
      to: 0.998 to Bob, 3.002 to Carol (see Figure 12-10 step 8). Finally, Bob
      claims the<br>
      HTLC from Alice (see Figure 12-10 step 9). Their channel balance is
      updated as:<br>
      0.997 to Alice, 3.003 to Bob.<br>
      300<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Chapter 12: Blockchain Applications<br>
      Alice has paid Eric 1 bitcoin without opening a channel to Eric. None of
      the inter‐<br>
      mediate parties in the payment route had to trust each other. For the
      short-term com‐<br>
      mitment of their funds in the channel they are able to earn a small fee,
      with the only<br>
      risk being a small delay in refund if the channel was closed or the routed
      payment<br>
      failed.<br>
      Lightning Network Transport and Routing<br>
      All communications between LN nodes are encrypted point-to-point. In
      addition,<br>
      nodes have a long-term public key that they use as an identifier and to
      authenticate<br>
      each other.<br>
      Whenever a node wishes to send a payment to another node, it must first
      construct a<br>
      path through the network by connecting payment channels with sufficient
      capacity.<br>
      Nodes advertise routing information, including what channels they have
      open, how<br>
      much capacity each channel has, and what fees they charge to route
      payments. The<br>
      routing information can be shared in a variety of ways and different
      routing protocols<br>
      are likely to emerge as Lightning Network technology advances. Some
      Lightning Net‐<br>
      work implementations use the IRC protocol as a convenient mechanism for
      nodes to<br>
      announce routing information. Another implementation of route discovery
      uses a<br>
      P2P model where nodes propagate channel announcements to their peers, in a<br>
      “flooding” model, similar to how bitcoin propagates transactions. Future
      plans<br>
      include a proposal called Flare, which is a hybrid routing model with
      local node<br>
      “neighborhoods” and longer-range beacon nodes.<br>
      In our previous example, Alice’s node uses one of these route discovery
      mechanisms<br>
      to find one or more paths connecting her node to Eric’s node. Once Alice’s
      node has<br>
      constructed a path, she will initialize that path through the network, by
      propagating a<br>
      series of encrypted and nested instructions to connect each of the
      adjacent payment<br>
      channels.<br>
      Importantly, this path is only known to Alice’s node. All other
      participants in the pay‐<br>
      ment route see only the adjacent nodes. From Carol’s perspective, this
      looks like a<br>
      payment from Bob to Diana. Carol does not know that Bob is actually
      relaying a pay‐<br>
      ment from Alice. She also doesn’t know that Diana will be relaying a
      payment to Eric.<br>
      This is a critical feature of the Lightning Network, because it ensures
      privacy of pay‐<br>
      ments and makes it very difficult to apply surveillance, censorship, or
      blacklists. But<br>
      how does Alice establish this payment path, without revealing anything to
      the inter‐<br>
      mediary nodes?<br>
      The Lightning Network implements an onion-routed protocol based on a
      scheme<br>
      called Sphinx. This routing protocol ensures that a payment sender can
      construct and<br>
      communicate a path through the Lightning Network such that:<br>
      Routed Payment Channels (Lightning Network)<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;301<br>
      • Intermediate nodes can verify and decrypt their portion of route
      information<br>
      and find the next hop.<br>
      • Other than the previous and next hops, they cannot learn about any other
      nodes<br>
      that are part of the path.<br>
      • They cannot identify the length of the payment path, or their own
      position in<br>
      that path.<br>
      • Each part of the path is encrypted in such a way that a network-level
      attacker<br>
      cannot associate the packets from different parts of the path to each
      other.<br>
      • Unlike Tor (an onion-routed anonymization protocol on the internet),
      there are<br>
      no “exit nodes” that can be placed under surveillance. The payments do not
      need<br>
      to be transmitted to the bitcoin blockchain; the nodes just update channel
      balan‐<br>
      ces.<br>
      Using this onion-routed protocol, Alice wraps each element of the path in
      a layer of<br>
      encryption, starting with the end and working backward. She encrypts a
      message to<br>
      Eric with Eric’s public key. This message is wrapped in a message
      encrypted to Diana,<br>
      identifying Eric as the next recipient. The message to Diana is wrapped in
      a message<br>
      encrypted to Carol’s public key and identifying Diana as the next
      recipient. The mes‐<br>
      sage to Carol is encrypted to Bob’s key. Thus, Alice has constructed this
      encrypted<br>
      multilayer “onion” of messages. She sends this to Bob, who can only
      decrypt and<br>
      unwrap the outer layer. Inside, Bob finds a message addressed to Carol
      that he can<br>
      forward to Carol but cannot decipher himself. Following the path, the
      messages get<br>
      forwarded, decrypted, forwarded, etc., all the way to Eric. Each
      participant knows<br>
      only the previous and next node in each hop.<br>
      Each element of the path contains information on the HTLC that must be
      extended<br>
      to the next hop, the amount that is being sent, the fee to include, and
      the CLTV lock‐<br>
      time (in blocks) expiration of the HTLC. As the route information
      propagates, the<br>
      nodes make HTLC commitments forward to the next hop.<br>
      At this point, you might be wondering how it is possible that the nodes do
      not know<br>
      the length of the path and their position in that path. After all, they
      receive a message<br>
      and forward it to the next hop. Doesn’t it get shorter, allowing them to
      deduce the<br>
      path size and their position? To prevent this, the path is always fixed at
      20 hops and<br>
      padded with random data. Each node sees the next hop and a fixed-length
      encrypted<br>
      message to forward. Only the final recipient sees that there is no next
      hop. To every‐<br>
      one else it seems as if there are always 20 more hops to go.<br>

      &nbsp;Chapter 12: Blockchain Applications<br>
      Lightning Network Benefits<br>
      A Lightning Network is a second-layer routing technology. It can be
      applied to any<br>
      blockchain that supports some basic capabilities, such as multisignature
      transactions,<br>
      timelocks, and basic smart contracts.<br>
      If a Lightning Network is layered on top of the bitcoin network, the
      bitcoin network<br>
      can gain a significant increase in capacity, privacy, granularity, and
      speed, without<br>
      sacrificing the principles of trustless operation without intermediaries:<br>
      Privacy<br>
      Lightning Network payments are much more private than payments on the bit‐<br>
      coin blockchain, as they are not public. While participants in a route can
      see pay‐<br>
      ments propagated across their channels, they do not know the sender or<br>
      recipient.<br>
      Fungibility<br>
      A Lightning Network makes it much more difficult to apply surveillance and<br>
      blacklists on bitcoin, increasing the fungibility of the currency.<br>
      Speed<br>
      Bitcoin transactions using Lightning Network are settled in milliseconds,
      rather<br>
      than minutes, as HTLCs are cleared without committing transactions to a
      block.<br>
      Granularity<br>
      A Lightning Network can enable payments at least as small as the bitcoin
      “dust”<br>
      limit, perhaps even smaller. Some proposals allow for subsatoshi
      increments.<br>
      Capacity<br>
      A Lightning Network increases the capacity of the bitcoin system by
      several<br>
      orders of magnitude. There is no practical upper bound to the number of
      pay‐<br>
      ments per second that can be routed over a Lightning Network, as it
      depends<br>
      only on the capacity and speed of each node.<br>
      Trustless Operation<br>
      A Lightning Network uses bitcoin transactions between nodes that operate
      as<br>
      peers without trusting each other. Thus, a Lightning Network preserves the
      prin‐<br>
      ciples of the bitcoin system, while expanding its operating parameters
      signifi‐<br>
      cantly.<br>
      Of course, as mentioned previously, the Lightning Network protocol is not
      the only<br>
      way to implement routed payment channels. Other proposed systems include
      Tum‐<br>
      blebit and Teechan. At this time, however, the Lightning Network has
      already been<br>
      deployed on testnet. Several different teams have developed competing
      implementa‐<br>
      tions of LN and are working toward a common interoperability standard
      (called<br>
      Routed Payment Channels (Lightning Network)<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;303<br>
      BOLT). It is likely that Lightning Network will be the first routed
      payment channel<br>
      network to be deployed in production.<br>
      Conclusion<br>
      We have examined just a few of the emerging applications that can be built
      using the<br>
      bitcoin blockchain as a trust platform. These applications expand the
      scope of bitcoin<br>
      beyond payments and beyond financial instruments, to encompass many other
      appli‐<br>
      cations where trust is critical. By decentralizing the basis of trust, the
      bitcoin block‐<br>
      chain is a platform that will spawn many revolutionary applications in a
      wide variety<br>
      of industries.<br>

      The Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi<br>

      Bitcoin - A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System<br>
      Satoshi Nakamoto<br>
      satoshin@gmx.com<br>
      www.bitcoin.org<br>
      Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow
      online pay‐<br>
      ments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through
      a financial<br>
      institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
      benefits are<br>
      lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent
      double-spending. We propose a<br>
      solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The
      network<br>
      timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
      hash-based proof-<br>
      of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the
      proof-of-<br>
      work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events
      witnessed,<br>
      but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a
      majority of<br>
      CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the
      network,<br>
      they’ll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network
      itself requires<br>
      minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and
      nodes can leave<br>
      and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain
      as proof of<br>
      what happened while they were gone.<br>
      305<br>
      Introduction<br>
      Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial
      institu‐<br>
      tions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments.
      While the sys‐<br>
      tem works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the
      inherent<br>
      weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible
      transactions are not<br>
      really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating
      disputes. The cost<br>
      of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical
      transaction<br>
      size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and
      there is a broader<br>
      cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for
      nonreversible services.<br>
      With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants
      must be wary of<br>
      their customers, hassling them for more information than they would
      otherwise<br>
      need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These
      costs and pay‐<br>
      ment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency,
      but no<br>
      mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a
      trus‐<br>
      ted party.<br>
      What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic
      proof<br>
      instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly
      with each other<br>
      without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are
      computationally<br>
      impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine
      escrow mecha‐<br>
      nisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In this paper, we
      propose a sol‐<br>
      ution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed
      timestamp<br>
      server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of
      transactions.<br>
      The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU
      power<br>
      than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.<br>
      Transactions<br>
      We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner
      transfers the<br>
      coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction
      and the public<br>
      key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can
      verify the<br>
      signatures to verify the chain of ownership.<br>
      306<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Appendix A: The Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto<br>
      The problem of course is the payee can’t verify that one of the owners did
      not double-<br>
      spend the coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central
      authority, or<br>
      mint, that checks every transaction for double spending. After each
      transaction, the<br>
      coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin, and only coins
      issued directly<br>
      from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent. The problem with this
      solution is<br>
      that the fate of the entire money system depends on the company running
      the mint,<br>
      with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.<br>
      We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign
      any ear‐<br>
      lier transactions. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one
      that counts, so<br>
      we don’t care about later attempts to double-spend. The only way to
      confirm the<br>
      absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions. In the mint
      based model,<br>
      the mint was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived first. To
      accomplish<br>
      this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly announced [1],
      and we<br>
      need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order
      in which they<br>
      were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction,
      the major‐<br>
      ity of nodes agreed it was the first received.<br>
      Timestamp Server<br>
      The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server. A timestamp server
      works<br>
      by taking a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely
      publishing the<br>
      hash, such as in a newspaper or Usenet post [2-5]. The timestamp proves
      that the<br>
      data must have existed at the time, obviously, in order to get into the
      hash. Each time‐<br>
      stamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain, with
      each addi‐<br>
      tional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.<br>

      Proof-of-Work<br>
      To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we
      will need to<br>
      use a proof-of-work system similar to Adam Back’s Hashcash [6], rather
      than news‐<br>
      paper or Usenet posts. The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value
      that when<br>
      hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits.
      The aver‐<br>
      age work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required and
      can be veri‐<br>
      fied by executing a single hash. For our timestamp network, we implement
      the proof-<br>
      of-work by incrementing a nonce in the block until a value is found that
      gives the<br>
      block’s hash the required zero bits. Once the CPU effort has been expended
      to make it<br>
      satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed without redoing the
      work. As<br>
      later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block would
      include redoing<br>
      all the blocks after it.<br>
      The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in
      majority<br>
      decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it
      could be<br>
      subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is
      essentially one-CPU-<br>
      one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which
      has the<br>
      greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power
      is controlled<br>
      by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any
      competing<br>
      chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the
      proof-of-work of<br>
      the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the
      work of the<br>
      honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker
      catching up<br>
      diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.<br>
      To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in
      running nodes<br>
      over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average
      targeting<br>
      an average number of blocks per hour. If they’re generated too fast, the
      difficulty<br>
      increases.<br>

      &nbsp;Appendix A: The Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto<br>
      Network<br>
      The steps to run the network are as follows:<br>
      1. New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.<br>
      2. Each node collects new transactions into a block.<br>
      3. Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.<br>
      4. When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all
      nodes.<br>
      5. Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not
      already<br>
      spent.<br>
      6. Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the
      next<br>
      block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous
      hash.<br>
      Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will
      keep working<br>
      on extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next
      block simultane‐<br>
      ously, some nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they
      work on the<br>
      first one they received, but save the other branch in case it becomes
      longer. The tie<br>
      will be broken when the next proof-of-work is found and one branch becomes<br>
      longer; the nodes that were working on the other branch will then switch
      to the<br>
      longer one.<br>
      New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes. As
      long as<br>
      they reach many nodes, they will get into a block before long. Block
      broadcasts are<br>
      also tolerant of dropped messages. If a node does not receive a block, it
      will request it<br>
      when it receives the next block and realizes it missed one.<br>
      Incentive<br>
      By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction
      that starts a new<br>
      coin owned by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes
      to support<br>
      the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into
      circulation, since<br>
      there is no central authority to issue them. The steady addition of a
      constant of<br>
      amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add
      gold to<br>
      circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.<br>
      The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output
      value of a trans‐<br>
      action is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee
      that is added to<br>
      the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. Once a
      predetermined<br>
      number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition
      entirely to<br>
      transaction fees and be completely inflation free.<br>
      The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy
      attacker is able to<br>
      assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose<br>
      The Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;309<br>
      between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using
      it to gener‐<br>
      ate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules,
      such rules that<br>
      favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to
      undermine<br>
      the system and the validity of his own wealth.<br>
      Reclaiming Disk Space<br>
      Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the
      spent trans‐<br>
      actions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this
      without break‐<br>
      ing the block’s hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7] [2]
      [5], with only the<br>
      root included in the block’s hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by
      stubbing off<br>
      branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored.<br>
      A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose
      blocks<br>
      are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 == 4.2MB per year.
      With<br>
      computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore’s
      Law<br>
      predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a
      problem even if<br>
      the block headers must be kept in memory.<br>
      Simplified Payment Verification<br>
      It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A
      user only<br>
      needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work
      chain, which<br>
      he can get by querying network nodes until he’s convinced he has the
      longest chain,<br>
      and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it’s
      timestamped in.<br>
      He can’t check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place
      in the chain, he<br>
      can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it
      further confirm<br>
      the network has accepted it.<br>
      310<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Appendix A: The Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto<br>
      As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the
      network, but is<br>
      more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While
      network nodes<br>
      can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be
      fooled by an<br>
      attacker’s fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can
      continue to over‐<br>
      power the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept
      alerts<br>
      from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user’s
      software<br>
      to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the
      inconsistency.<br>
      Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run
      their own<br>
      nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.<br>
      Combining and Splitting Value<br>
      Although it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be
      unwieldy to<br>
      make a separate transaction for every cent in a transfer. To allow value
      to be split and<br>
      combined, transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs. Normally there
      will be<br>
      either a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple
      inputs combining<br>
      smaller amounts, and at most two outputs: one for the payment, and one
      returning<br>
      the change, if any, back to the sender.<br>
      It should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several
      transactions,<br>
      and those transactions depend on many more, is not a problem here. There
      is never<br>
      the need to extract a complete standalone copy of a transaction’s history.<br>

      Privacy<br>
      The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting
      access to infor‐<br>
      mation to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity
      to announce<br>
      all transactions publicly precludes this method, but privacy can still be
      maintained by<br>
      breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys
      anony‐<br>
      mous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone
      else, but<br>
      without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is similar to
      the level of<br>
      information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of
      individual<br>
      trades, the “tape”, is made public, but without telling who the parties
      were.<br>
      As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each
      transaction to keep<br>
      them from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still
      unavoidable with<br>
      multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were
      owned by the<br>
      same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking
      could reveal<br>
      other transactions that belonged to the same owner.<br>
      Calculations<br>
      We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate
      chain faster<br>
      than the honest chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the
      system open<br>
      to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking
      money that never<br>
      belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid
      transaction as pay‐<br>
      ment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An
      attacker can<br>
      only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he
      recently spent.<br>
      The race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be
      characterized as a<br>
      Binomial Random Walk. The success event is the honest chain being extended
      by one<br>
      block, increasing its lead by +1, and the failure event is the attacker’s
      chain being<br>
      extended by one block, reducing the gap by -1.<br>
      The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is
      analogous to a<br>
      Gambler’s Ruin problem. Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit starts at
      a deficit<br>
      and plays potentially an infinite number of trials to try to reach
      breakeven. We can<br>
      312<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Appendix A: The Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto<br>
      calculate the probability he ever reaches breakeven, or that an attacker
      ever catches<br>
      up with the honest chain, as follows [8]:<br>
      p == probability an honest node finds the next block<br>
      q == probability the attacker finds the next block<br>
      qz == probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind<br>
      Given our assumption that p &gt; q, the probability drops exponentially as
      the number<br>
      of blocks the attacker has to catch up with increases. With the odds
      against him, if he<br>
      doesn’t make a lucky lunge forward early on, his chances become
      vanishingly small as<br>
      he falls further behind.<br>
      We now consider how long the recipient of a new transaction needs to wait
      before<br>
      being sufficiently certain the sender can’t change the transaction. We
      assume the<br>
      sender is an attacker who wants to make the recipient believe he paid him
      for a while,<br>
      then switch it to pay back to himself after some time has passed. The
      receiver will be<br>
      alerted when that happens, but the sender hopes it will be too late.<br>
      The receiver generates a new key pair and gives the public key to the
      sender shortly<br>
      before signing. This prevents the sender from preparing a chain of blocks
      ahead of<br>
      time by working on it continuously until he is lucky enough to get far
      enough ahead,<br>
      then executing the transaction at that moment. Once the transaction is
      sent, the dis‐<br>
      honest sender starts working in secret on a parallel chain containing an
      alternate ver‐<br>
      sion of his transaction.<br>
      The recipient waits until the transaction has been added to a block and z
      blocks have<br>
      been linked after it. He doesn’t know the exact amount of progress the
      attacker has<br>
      made, but assuming the honest blocks took the average expected time per
      block, the<br>
      attacker’s potential progress will be a Poisson distribution with expected
      value:<br>
      To get the probability the attacker could still catch up now, we multiply
      the Poisson<br>
      density for each amount of progress he could have made by the probability
      he could<br>
      catch up from that point:<br>

      Conclusion<br>
      We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on
      trust. We<br>
      started with the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures,
      which pro‐<br>
      vides strong control of ownership, but is incomplete without a way to
      prevent double-<br>
      spending. To solve this, we proposed a peer-to-peer network using
      proof-of-work to<br>
      record a public history of transactions that quickly becomes
      computationally imprac‐<br>
      tical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU
      power. The<br>
      network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes work all at once
      with little<br>
      coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are not
      routed to any<br>
      particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis.
      Nodes can leave<br>
      and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof
      of what<br>
      happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing
      their<br>
      acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting
      invalid blocks<br>
      by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be
      enforced with<br>
      this consensus mechanism.<br>

      APPENDIX C<br>
      Bitcoin Improvement Proposals<br>
      Bitcoin Improvement Proposals are design documents providing information
      to the<br>
      bitcoin community, or for describing a new feature for bitcoin or its
      processes or<br>
      environment.<br>
      As per BIP-01 BIP Purpose and Guidelines, there are three kinds of BIPs:<br>
      Standard BIP<br>
      Describes any change that affects most or all bitcoin implementations,
      such as a<br>
      change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity
      rules, or<br>
      any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications
      using bit‐<br>
      coin.<br>
      Informational BIP<br>
      Describes a bitcoin design issue, or provides general guidelines or
      information to<br>
      the bitcoin community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational
      BIPs<br>
      do not necessarily represent a bitcoin community consensus or
      recommendation,<br>
      so users and implementors may ignore informational BIPs or follow their
      advice.<br>
      Process BIP<br>
      Describes a bitcoin process, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a
      process.<br>
      Process BIPs are like standard BIPs but apply to areas other than the
      bitcoin pro‐<br>
      tocol itself. They might propose an implementation, but not to bitcoin’s
      codebase;<br>
      they often require community consensus; and unlike informational BIPs,
      they are<br>
      more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore
      them.<br>
      Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making
      pro‐<br>
      cess, and changes to the tools or environment used in bitcoin development.
      Any<br>
      meta-BIP is also considered a process BIP.<br>
      323<br>
      BIPs are recorded in a versioned repository on GitHub:
      https://github.com/bitcoin/<br>
      bips. Table C-1 shows a snapshot of the BIPs in April 2017. Consult the

      SegregatedAPPENDIX D<br>
      Witness<br>
      Segregated Witness (segwit) is an upgrade to the bitcoin consensus rules
      and network<br>
      protocol, proposed and implemented as a BIP-9 soft-fork that is currently
      (mid-2017)<br>
      pending activation.<br>
      In cryptography, the term “witness” is used to describe a solution to a
      cryptographic<br>
      puzzle. In bitcoin terms, the witness satisfies a cryptographic condition
      placed on a<br>
      unspent transaction output (UTXO).<br>
      In the context of bitcoin, a digital signature is one type of witness, but
      a witness is<br>
      more broadly any solution that can satisfy the conditions imposed on an
      UTXO and<br>
      unlock that UTXO for spending. The term “witness” is a more general term
      for an<br>
      “unlocking script” or “scriptSig.”<br>
      Before segwit’s introduction, every input in a transaction was followed by
      the witness<br>
      data that unlocked it. The witness data was embedded in the transaction as
      part of<br>
      each input. The term segregated witness, or segwit for short, simply means
      separating<br>
      the signature or unlocking script of a specific output. Think “separate
      scriptSig,” or<br>
      “separate signature” in the simplest form.<br>
      Segregated Witness therefore is an architectural change to bitcoin that
      aims to move<br>
      the witness data from the scriptSig (unlocking script) field of a
      transaction into a<br>
      separate witness data structure that accompanies a transaction. Clients
      may request<br>
      transaction data with or without the accompanying witness data.<br>
      In this section we will look at some of the benefits of Segregated
      Witness, describe the<br>
      mechanism used to deploy and implement this architecture change, and
      demonstrate<br>
      the use of Segregated Witness in transactions and addresses.<br>

      Segregated Witness is defined by the following BIPs:<br>

      Why Segregated Witness?<br>
      Segregated Witness is an architectural change that has several effects on
      the scalabil‐<br>
      ity, security, economic incentives, and performance of bitcoin:<br>
      Transaction Malleability<br>
      By moving the witness outside the transaction, the transaction hash used
      as an<br>
      identifier no longer includes the witness data. Since the witness data is
      the only<br>
      part of the transaction that can be modified by a third party (see
      “Transaction<br>
      identifiers” on page 338), removing it also removes the opportunity for
      transac‐<br>
      tion malleability attacks. With Segregated Witness, transaction hashes
      become<br>
      immutable by anyone other than the creator of the transaction, which
      greatly<br>
      improves the implementation of many other protocols that rely on advanced
      bit‐<br>
      coin transaction construction, such as payment channels, chained
      transactions,<br>
      and lightning networks.<br>
      Script Versioning<br>
      With the introduction of Segregated Witness scripts, every locking script
      is pre‐<br>
      ceded by a script version number, similar to how transactions and blocks
      have<br>
      version numbers. The addition of a script version number allows the
      scripting<br>
      language to be upgraded in a backward-compatible way (i.e., using soft
      fork<br>
      upgrades) to introduce new script operands, syntax, or semantics. The
      ability to<br>
      upgrade the scripting language in a nondisruptive way will greatly
      accelerate the<br>
      rate of innovation in bitcoin.<br>
      Network and Storage Scaling<br>
      The witness data is often a big contributor to the total size of a
      transaction. More<br>
      complex scripts such as those used for multisig or payment channels are
      very<br>
      large. In some cases these scripts account for the majority (more than
      75%) of the<br>
      data in a transaction. By moving the witness data outside the transaction,
      Segre‐<br>
      gated Witness improves bitcoin’s scalability. Nodes can prune the witness
      data<br>
      after validating the signatures, or ignore it altogether when doing
      simplified pay‐<br>
      330<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Appendix D: Segregated Witness<br>
      ment verification. The witness data doesn’t need to be transmitted to all
      nodes<br>
      and does not need to be stored on disk by all nodes.<br>
      Signature Verification Optimization<br>
      Segregated Witness upgrades the signature functions (CHECKSIG,
      CHECKMULTISIG,<br>
      etc.) to reduce the algorithm’s computational complexity. Before segwit,
      the algo‐<br>
      rithm used to produce a signature required a number of hash operations
      that was<br>
      proportional to the size of the transaction. Data-hashing computations
      increased<br>
      in O(n2) with respect to the number of signature operations, introducing a
      sub‐<br>
      stantial computational burden on all nodes verifying the signature. With
      segwit,<br>
      the algorithm is changed to reduce the complexity to O(n).<br>
      Offline Signing Improvement<br>
      Segregated Witness signatures incorporate the value (amount) referenced by
      each<br>
      input in the hash that is signed. Previously, an offline signing device,
      such as a<br>
      hardware wallet, would have to verify the amount of each input before
      signing a<br>
      transaction. This was usually accomplished by streaming a large amount of
      data<br>
      about the previous transactions referenced as inputs. Since the amount is
      now<br>
      part of the commitment hash that is signed, an offline device does not
      need the<br>
      previous transactions. If the amounts do not match (are misrepresented by
      a<br>
      compromised online system), the signature will be invalid.<br>
      How Segregated Witness Works<br>
      At first glance, Segregated Witness appears to be a change to how
      transactions are<br>
      constructed and therefore a transaction-level feature, but it is not. In
      fact, Segregated<br>
      Witness is also a change to how individual UTXO are spent and therefore is
      a per-<br>
      output feature.<br>
      A transaction can spend Segregated Witness outputs or traditional
      (inline-witness)<br>
      outputs or both. Therefore, it does not make much sense to refer to a
      transaction as a<br>
      “Segregated Witness transaction.” Rather we should refer to specific
      transaction<br>
      inputs as “Segregated Witness inputs.”<br>
      When a transaction spends an UTXO, it must provide a witness. In a
      traditional<br>
      UTXO, the locking script requires that witness data be provided inline in
      the input<br>
      part of the transaction that spends the UTXO. A Segregated Witness UTXO,
      however,<br>
      specifies a locking script that can be satisfied with witness data outside
      of the input<br>
      (segregated).<br>
      Soft Fork (Backward Compatibility)<br>
      Segregated Witness is a significant change to the way outputs and
      transactions are<br>
      architected. Such a change would normally require a simultaneous change in
      every<br>
      bitcoin node and wallet to change the consensus rules—what is known as a
      hard fork.<br>
      Segregated Witness<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;331<br>
      Instead, segregated witness is introduced with a much less disruptive
      change, which is<br>
      backward compatible, known as a soft fork. This type of upgrade allows
      nonupgraded<br>
      software to ignore the changes and continue to operate without any
      disruption.<br>
      Segregated Witness outputs are constructed so that older systems that are
      not segwit-<br>
      aware can still validate them. To an old wallet or node, a Segregated
      Witness output<br>
      looks like an output that anyone can spend. Such outputs can be spent with
      an empty<br>
      signature, therefore the fact that there is no signature inside the
      transaction (it is seg‐<br>
      regated) does not invalidate the transaction. Newer wallets and mining
      nodes, how‐<br>
      ever, see the Segregated Witness output and expect to find a valid witness
      for it in the<br>
      transaction’s witness data.<br>
      Segregated Witness Output and Transaction Examples<br>
      Let’s look at some of our example transactions and see how they would
      change with<br>
      Segregated Witness. We’ll first look at how a Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash
      (P2PKH) pay‐<br>
      ment is transformed with the Segregated Witness program. Then, we’ll look
      at the<br>
      Segregated Witness equivalent for Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) scripts.
      Finally, we’ll<br>
      look at how both of the preceding Segregated Witness programs can be
      embedded<br>
      inside a P2SH script.<br>
      Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2WPKH)<br>
      In “Buying a Cup of Coffee” on page 16, Alice created a transaction to pay
      Bob for a<br>
      cup of coffee. That transaction created a P2PKH output with a value of
      0.015 BTC<br>
      that was spendable by Bob. The output’s script looks like this:<br>
      DUP HASH160 ab68025513c3dbd2f7b92a94e0581f5d50f654e7 EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG<br>
      With Segregated Witness, Alice would create a
      Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash<br>
      (P2WPKH) script, which looks like this:<br>
      0 ab68025513c3dbd2f7b92a94e0581f5d50f654e7<br>
      As you can see, a Segregated Witness output’s locking script is much
      simpler than a<br>
      traditional output. It consists of two values that are pushed on to the
      script evaluation<br>
      stack. To an old (nonsegwit-aware) bitcoin client, the two pushes would
      look like an<br>
      output that anyone can spend and does not require a signature (or rather,
      can be<br>
      spent with an empty signature). To a newer, segwit-aware client, the first
      number (0)<br>
      is interpreted as a version number (the witness version) and the second
      part (20 bytes)<br>
      is the equivalent of a locking script known as a witness program. The
      20-byte witness<br>
      program is simply the hash of the public key, as in a P2PKH script<br>
      Now, let’s look at the corresponding transaction that Bob uses to spend
      this output.<br>
      For the original script (nonsegwit), Bob’s transaction would have to
      include a signa‐<br>
      ture within the transaction input:<br>
      332<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Appendix D: Segregated Witness<br>
      [...]<br>
      “Vin” : [<br>

      "vout": 0,<br>
      "scriptSig": “&lt;Bob’s scriptSig&gt;”,<br>
      ]<br>
      [...]<br>
      However, to spend the Segregated Witness output, the transaction has no
      signature<br>
      on that input. Instead, Bob’s transaction has an empty scriptSig and
      includes a Seg‐<br>
      regated Witness, outside the transaction itself:<br>

      “witness”: “&lt;Bob’s witness data&gt;”<br>
      [...]<br>
      Wallet construction of P2WPKH<br>
      It is extremely important to note that P2WPKH should only be created by
      the payee<br>
      (recipient) and not converted by the sender from a known public key, P2PKH
      script,<br>
      or address. The sender has no way of knowing if the recipient’s wallet has
      the ability<br>
      to construct segwit transactions and spend P2WPKH outputs.<br>
      Additionally, P2WPKH outputs must be constructed from the hash of a
      compressed<br>
      public key. Uncompressed public keys are nonstandard in segwit and may be
      explic‐<br>
      itly disabled by a future soft fork. If the hash used in the P2WPKH came
      from an<br>
      uncompressed public key, it may be unspendable and you may lose funds.
      P2WPKH<br>
      outputs should be created by the payee’s wallet by deriving a compressed
      public key<br>
      from their private key.<br>
      P2WPKH should be constructed by the payee (recipient) by con‐<br>
      verting a compressed public key to a P2WPKH hash. You should<br>
      never transform a P2PKH script, bitcoin address, or uncompressed<br>
      public key to a P2WPKH witness script.<br>
      Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash (P2WSH)<br>
      The second type of witness program corresponds to a Pay-to-Script-Hash
      (P2SH)<br>
      script. We saw this type of script in “Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH)” on page
      151. In that<br>
      example, P2SH was used by Mohammed’s company to express a multisignature<br>
      script. Payments to Mohammed’s company were encoded with a locking script
      like<br>
      this:<br>
      Segregated Witness<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;333<br>
      HASH160 54c557e07dde5bb6cb791c7a540e0a4796f5e97e EQUAL<br>
      This P2SH script references the hash of a redeem script that defines a
      2-of-3 multi‐<br>
      signature requirement to spend funds. To spend this output, Mohammed’s
      company<br>
      would present the redeem script (whose hash matches the script hash in the
      P2SH<br>
      output) and the signatures necessary to satisfy that redeem script, all
      inside the trans‐<br>
      action input:<br>
      [...]<br>
      “Vin” : [<br>
      "txid": "abcdef12345...",<br>
      "vout": 0,<br>
      "scriptSig": “&lt;SigA&gt; &lt;SigB&gt; &lt;2 PubA PubB PubC PubD PubE 5
      CHECKMULTI-<br>
      SIG&gt;”,<br>
      ]<br>
      Now, let’s look at how this entire example would be upgraded to segwit. If
      Moham‐<br>
      med’s customers were using a segwit-compatible wallet, they would make a
      payment,<br>
      creating a Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash (P2WSH) output that would look like
      this:<br>
      0 9592d601848d04b172905e0ddb0adde59f1590f1e553ffc81ddc4b0ed927dd73<br>
      Again, as with the example of P2WPKH, you can see that the Segregated
      Witness<br>
      equivalent script is a lot simpler and omits the various script operands
      that you see in<br>
      P2SH scripts. Instead, the Segregated Witness program consists of two
      values pushed<br>
      to the stack: a witness version (0) and the 32-byte SHA256 hash of the
      redeem script.<br>
      While P2SH uses the 20-byte RIPEMD160(SHA256(script)) hash,<br>
      the P2WSH witness program uses a 32-byte SHA256(script) hash.<br>
      This difference in the selection of the hashing algorithm is deliber‐<br>
      ate and is used to differentiate between the two types of witness<br>
      programs (P2WPKH and P2WSH) by the length of the hash and to<br>
      provide stronger security to P2WSH (128 bits versus 80 bits of<br>
      P2SH).<br>
      Mohammed’s company can spend outputs the P2WSH output by presenting the
      cor‐<br>
      rect redeem script and sufficient signatures to satisfy it. Both the
      redeem script and<br>
      the signatures would be segregated outside the spending transaction as
      part of the<br>
      witness data. Within the transaction input, Mohammed’s wallet would put an
      empty<br>
      scriptSig:<br>
      [...]<br>
      “Vin” : [<br>
      "txid": "abcdef12345...",<br>
      "vout": 0,<br>
      "scriptSig": “”,<br>
      ]<br>
      [...]<br>

      “witness”: “&lt;SigA&gt; &lt;SigB&gt; &lt;2 PubA PubB PubC PubD PubE 5
      CHECKMULTISIG&gt;”<br>
      [...]<br>
      Differentiating between P2WPKH and P2WSH<br>
      In the previous two sections, we demonstrated two types of witness
      programs: “Pay-<br>
      to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2WPKH)” on page 332 and
      “Pay-to-Witness-Script-<br>
      Hash (P2WSH)” on page 333. Both types of witness programs consist of a
      single byte<br>
      version number followed by a longer hash. They look very similar, but are
      interpreted<br>
      very differently: one is interpreted as a public key hash, which is
      satisfied by a signa‐<br>
      ture and the other as a script hash, which is satisfied by a redeem
      script. The critical<br>
      difference between them is the length of the hash:<br>
      • The public key hash in P2WPKH is 20 bytes<br>
      • The script hash in P2WSH is 32 bytes<br>
      This is the one difference that allows a wallet to differentiate between
      the two types of<br>
      witness programs. By looking at the length of the hash, a wallet can
      determine what<br>
      type of witness program it is, P2WPKH or P2WSH.<br>
      Upgrading to Segregated Witness<br>
      As we can see from the previous examples, upgrading to Segregated Witness
      is a two-<br>
      step process. First, wallets must create special segwit type outputs.
      Then, these out‐<br>
      puts can be spent by wallets that know how to construct Segregated Witness<br>
      transactions. In the examples, Alice’s wallet was segwit-aware and able to
      create spe‐<br>
      cial outputs with Segregated Witness scripts. Bob’s wallet is also
      segwit-aware and<br>
      able to spend those outputs. What may not be obvious from the example is
      that in<br>
      practice, Alice’s wallet needs to know that Bob uses a segwit-aware wallet
      and can<br>
      spend these outputs. Otherwise, if Bob’s wallet is not upgraded and Alice
      tries to<br>
      make segwit payments to Bob, Bob’s wallet will not be able to detect these
      payments.<br>
      For P2WPKH and P2WSH payment types, both the sender and the<br>
      recipient wallets need to be upgraded to be able to use segwit. Fur‐<br>
      thermore, the sender’s wallet needs to know that the recipient’s wal‐<br>
      let is segwit-aware.<br>
      Segregated Witness will not be implemented simultaneously across the
      entire net‐<br>
      work. Rather, Segregated Witness is implemented as a backward-compatible
      upgrade,<br>
      where old and new clients can coexist. Wallet developers will
      independently upgrade<br>
      wallet software to add segwit capabilities. The P2WPKH and P2WSH payment
      types<br>
      are used when both sender and recipient are segwit-aware. The traditional
      P2PKH<br>
      Segregated Witness<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;335<br>
      and P2SH will continue to work for nonupgraded wallets. That leaves two
      important<br>
      scenarios, which are addressed in the next section:<br>
      • Ability of a sender’s wallet that is not segwit-aware to make a payment
      to a recipi‐<br>
      ent’s wallet that can process segwit transactions<br>
      • Ability of a sender’s wallet that is segwit-aware to recognize and
      distinguish<br>
      between recipients that are segwit-aware and ones that are not, by their
      addresses<br>
      Embedding Segregated Witness inside P2SH<br>
      Let’s assume, for example, that Alice’s wallet is not upgraded to segwit,
      but Bob’s wal‐<br>
      let is upgraded and can handle segwit transactions. Alice and Bob can use
      “old” non-<br>
      segwit transactions. But Bob would likely want to use segwit to reduce
      transaction<br>
      fees, taking advantage of the discount that applies to witness data.<br>
      In this case Bob’s wallet can construct a P2SH address that contains a
      segwit script<br>
      inside it. Alice’s wallet sees this as a “normal” P2SH address and can
      make payments<br>
      to it without any knowledge of segwit. Bob’s wallet can then spend this
      payment with<br>
      a segwit transaction, taking full advantage of segwit and reducing
      transaction fees.<br>
      Both forms of witness scripts, P2WPKH and P2WSH, can be embedded in a P2SH<br>
      address. The first is noted as P2SH(P2WPKH) and the second is noted as<br>
      P2SH(P2WSH).<br>
      Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash inside Pay-to-Script-Hash<br>
      The first form of witness script we will examine is P2SH(P2WPKH). This is
      a Pay-to-<br>
      Witness-Public-Key-Hash witness program, embedded inside a
      Pay-to-Script-Hash<br>
      script, so that it can be used by a wallet that is not aware of segwit.<br>
      Bob’s wallet constructs a P2WPKH witness program with Bob’s public key.
      This wit‐<br>
      ness program is then hashed and the resulting hash is encoded as a P2SH
      script. The<br>
      P2SH script is converted to a bitcoin address, one that starts with a “3,”
      as we saw in<br>
      the “Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH)” on page 151 section.<br>
      Bob’s wallet starts with the P2WPKH witness program we saw earlier:<br>
      0 ab68025513c3dbd2f7b92a94e0581f5d50f654e7<br>
      The P2WPKH witness program consists of the witness version and Bob’s
      20-byte<br>
      public key hash.<br>
      Bob’s wallet then hashes the preceding witness program, first with SHA256,
      then with<br>
      RIPEMD160, producing another 20-byte hash:<br>
      3e0547268b3b19288b3adef9719ec8659f4b2b0b<br>
      336<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Appendix D: Segregated Witness<br>
      The hash of the witness program is then embedded in a P2SH script:<br>
      HASH160 3e0547268b3b19288b3adef9719ec8659f4b2b0b EQUAL<br>
      Finally, the P2SH script is converted to a P2SH bitcoin address:<br>
      37Lx99uaGn5avKBxiW26HjedQE3LrDCZru<br>
      Now, Bob can display this address for customers to pay for their coffee.
      Alice’s wallet<br>
      can make a payment to 37Lx99uaGn5avKBxiW26HjedQE3LrDCZru, just as it would
      to<br>
      any other bitcoin address. Even though Alice’s wallet has no support for
      segwit, the<br>
      payment it creates can be spent by Bob with a segwit transaction.<br>
      Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash inside Pay-to-Script-Hash<br>
      Similarly, a P2WSH witness program for a multisig script or other
      complicated script<br>
      can be embedded inside a P2SH script and address, making it possible for
      any wallet<br>
      to make payments that are segwit compatible.<br>
      As we saw in “Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash (P2WSH)” on page 333, Mohammed’s<br>
      company is using Segregated Witness payments to multisignature scripts. To
      make it<br>
      possible for any client to pay his company, regardless of whether their
      wallets are<br>
      upgraded for segwit, Mohammed’s wallet can embed the P2WSH witness program<br>
      inside a P2SH script.<br>
      First, Mohammed’s wallet creates the P2WSH witness program that
      corresponds to<br>
      the multisignature script, hashed with SHA256:<br>
      0 9592d601848d04b172905e0ddb0adde59f1590f1e553ffc81ddc4b0ed927dd73<br>
      Then, the witness program itself is hashed with SHA256 and RIPEMD160,
      producing<br>
      a new 20-byte hash, as used in traditional P2SH:<br>
      86762607e8fe87c0c37740cddee880988b9455b2<br>
      Next, Mohammed’s wallet puts the hash into a P2SH script:<br>
      HASH160 86762607e8fe87c0c37740cddee880988b9455b2 EQUAL<br>
      Finally, the wallet constructs a bitcoin address from this script:<br>
      3Dwz1MXhM6EfFoJChHCxh1jWHb8GQqRenG<br>
      Now, Mohammed’s clients can make payments to this address without any need
      to<br>
      support segwit. Mohammed’s company can then construct segwit transactions
      to<br>
      spend these payments, taking advantage of segwit features including lower
      transac‐<br>
      tion fees.<br>

      &nbsp;337<br>
      Segregated Witness addresses<br>
      After segwit is deployed on the bitcoin network, it will take some time
      until wallets<br>
      are upgraded. It is quite likely therefore that segwit will mostly be used
      embedded in<br>
      P2SH, as we saw in the previous section, at least for several months.<br>
      Eventually, however, almost all wallets will be able to support segwit
      payments. At<br>
      that time it will no longer be necessary to embed segwit in P2SH. It is
      therefore likely<br>
      that a new form of bitcoin address will be created, one that indicates the
      recipient is<br>
      segwit-aware and that directly encodes a witness program. There have been
      a number<br>
      of proposals for a Segregated Witness address scheme, but none have been
      actively<br>
      pursued.<br>
      Transaction identifiers<br>
      One of the greatest benefits of Segregated Witness is that it eliminates
      third-party<br>
      transaction malleability.<br>
      Before segwit, transactions could have their signatures subtly modified by
      third par‐<br>
      ties, changing their transaction ID (hash) without changing any
      fundamental proper‐<br>
      ties (inputs, outputs, amounts). This created opportunities for
      denial-of-service<br>
      attacks as well as attacks against poorly written wallet software that
      assumed uncon‐<br>
      firmed transaction hashes were immutable.<br>
      With the introduction of Segregated Witness, transactions have two
      identifiers, txid<br>
      and wtxid. The traditional transaction ID txid is the double-SHA256 hash
      of the<br>
      serialized transaction, without the witness data. A transaction wtxid is
      the double-<br>
      SHA256 hash of the new serialization format of the transaction with
      witness data.<br>
      The traditional txid is calculated in exactly the same way as with a
      nonsegwit trans‐<br>
      action. However, since the segwit transaction has empty scriptSigs in
      every input,<br>
      there is no part of the transaction that can be modified by a third party.
      Therefore, in<br>
      a segwit transaction, the txid is immutable by a third party, even when
      the transac‐<br>
      tion is unconfirmed.<br>
      The wtxid is like an “extended” ID, in that the hash also incorporates the
      witness<br>
      data. If a transaction is transmitted without witness data, then the wtxid
      and txid are<br>
      identical. Note than since the wtxid includes witness data (signatures)
      and since wit‐<br>
      ness data may be malleable, the wtxid should be considered malleable until
      the trans‐<br>
      action is confirmed. Only the txid of a segwit transaction can be
      considered<br>
      immutable by third parties and only if all the inputs of the transaction
      are segwit<br>
      inputs.<br>
      338<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Appendix D: Segregated Witness<br>
      Segregated Witness transactions have two IDs: txid and wtxid.<br>
      The txid is the hash of the transaction without the witness data<br>
      and the wtxid is the hash inclusive of witness data. The txid of a<br>
      transaction where all inputs are segwit inputs is not susceptible to<br>
      third-party transaction malleability.<br>
      Segregated Witness’ New Signing Algorithm<br>
      Segregated Witness modifies the semantics of the four signature
      verification func‐<br>
      tions (CHECKSIG, CHECKSIGVERIFY, CHECKMULTISIG, and CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY),<br>
      changing the way a transaction commitment hash is calculated.<br>
      Signatures in bitcoin transactions are applied on a commitment hash, which
      is calcu‐<br>
      lated from the transaction data, locking specific parts of the data
      indicating the sign‐<br>
      er’s commitment to those values. For example, in a simple SIGHASH_ALL type<br>
      signature, the commitment hash includes all inputs and outputs.<br>
      Unfortunately, the way the commitment hash was calculated introduced the
      possibil‐<br>
      ity that a node verifying the signature can be forced to perform a
      significant number<br>
      of hash computations. Specifically, the hash operations increase in O(n 2)
      with respect<br>
      to the number of signature operations in the transaction. An attacker
      could therefore<br>
      create a transaction with a very large number of signature operations,
      causing the<br>
      entire bitcoin network to have to perform hundreds or thousands of hash
      operations<br>
      to verify the transaction.<br>
      Segwit represented an opportunity to address this problem by changing the
      way the<br>
      commitment hash is calculated. For segwit version 0 witness programs,
      signature ver‐<br>
      ification occurs using an improved commitment hash algorithm as specified
      in<br>
      BIP-143.<br>
      The new algorithm achieves two important goals. Firstly, the number of
      hash opera‐<br>
      tions increases by a much more gradual O(n) to the number of signature
      operations,<br>
      reducing the opportunity to create denial-of-service attacks with overly
      complex<br>
      transactions. Secondly, the commitment hash now also includes the value
      (amounts)<br>
      of each input as part of the commitment. This means that a signer can
      commit to a<br>
      specific input value without needing to “fetch” and check the previous
      transaction<br>
      referenced by the input. In the case of offline devices, such as hardware
      wallets, this<br>
      greatly simplifies the communication between the host and the hardware
      wallet,<br>
      removing the need to stream previous transactions for validation. A
      hardware wallet<br>
      can accept the input value “as stated” by an untrusted host. Since the
      signature is<br>
      invalid if that input value is not correct, the hardware wallet doesn’t
      need to validate<br>
      the value before signing the input.<br>
      Segregated Witness<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;339<br>
      Economic Incentives for Segregated Witness<br>
      Bitcoin mining nodes and full nodes incur costs for the resources used to
      support the<br>
      bitcoin network and the blockchain. As the volume of bitcoin transactions
      increases,<br>
      so does the cost of resources (CPU, network bandwidth, disk space,
      memory). Miners<br>
      are compensated for these costs through fees that are proportional to the
      size (in<br>
      bytes) of each transaction. Nonmining full nodes are not compensated, so
      they incur<br>
      these costs because they have a need to run an authoritative fully
      validating full-index<br>
      node, perhaps because they use the node to operate a bitcoin business.<br>
      Without transaction fees, the growth in bitcoin data would arguably
      increase dramat‐<br>
      ically. Fees are intended to align the needs of bitcoin users with the
      burden their<br>
      transactions impose on the network, through a market-based price discovery
      mecha‐<br>
      nism.<br>
      The calculation of fees based on transaction size treats all the data in
      the transaction<br>
      as equal in cost. But from the perspective of full nodes and miners, some
      parts of a<br>
      transaction carry much higher costs. Every transaction added to the
      bitcoin network<br>
      affects the consumption of four resources on nodes:<br>
      Disk Space<br>
      Every transaction is stored in the blockchain, adding to the total size of
      the<br>
      blockchain. The blockchain is stored on disk, but the storage can be
      optimized by<br>
      “pruning” older transactions.<br>
      CPU<br>
      Every transaction must be validated, which requires CPU time.<br>
      Bandwidth<br>
      Every transaction is transmitted (through flood propagation) across the
      network<br>
      at least once. Without any optimization in the block propagation protocol,
      trans‐<br>
      actions are transmitted again as part of a block, doubling the impact on
      network<br>
      capacity.<br>
      Memory<br>
      Nodes that validate transactions keep the UTXO index or the entire UTXO
      set in<br>
      memory to speed up validation. Because memory is at least one order of
      magni‐<br>
      tude more expensive than disk, growth of the UTXO set contributes
      dispropor‐<br>
      tionately to the cost of running a node.<br>
      As you can see from the list, not every part of a transaction has an equal
      impact on<br>
      the cost of running a node or on the ability of bitcoin to scale to
      support more trans‐<br>
      actions. The most expensive part of a transaction are the newly created
      outputs, as<br>
      they are added to the in-memory UTXO set. By comparison, signatures (aka
      witness<br>
      data) add the least burden to the network and the cost of running a node,
      because<br>
      witness data are only validated once and then never used again.
      Furthermore, imme‐<br>
      340<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;Appendix D: Segregated Witness<br>
      diately after receiving a new transaction and validating witness data,
      nodes can dis‐<br>
      card that witness data. If fees are calculated on transaction size,
      without<br>
      discriminating between these two types of data, then the market incentives
      of fees are<br>
      not aligned with the actual costs imposed by a transaction. In fact, the
      current fee<br>
      structure actually encourages the opposite behavior, because witness data
      is the larg‐<br>
      est part of a transaction.<br>
      The incentives created by fees matter because they affect the behavior of
      wallets. All<br>
      wallets must implement some strategy for assembling transactions that
      takes into<br>
      consideration a number of factors, such as privacy (reducing address
      reuse), frag‐<br>
      mentation (making lots of loose change), and fees. If the fees are
      overwhelmingly<br>
      motivating wallets to use as few inputs as possible in transactions, this
      can lead to<br>
      UTXO picking and change address strategies that inadvertently bloat the
      UTXO set.<br>
      Transactions consume UTXO in their inputs and create new UTXO with their
      out‐<br>
      puts. A transaction, therefore, that has more inputs than outputs will
      result in a<br>
      decrease in the UTXO set, whereas a transaction that has more outputs than
      inputs<br>
      will result in an increase in the UTXO set. Let’s consider the difference
      between inputs<br>
      and outputs and call that the “Net-new-UTXO.” That’s an important metric,
      as it tells<br>
      us what impact a transaction will have on the most expensive network-wide
      resource,<br>
      the in-memory UTXO set. A transaction with positive Net-new-UTXO adds to
      that<br>
      burden. A transaction with a negative Net-new-UTXO reduces the burden. We
      would<br>
      therefore want to encourage transactions that are either negative
      Net-new-UTXO or<br>
      neutral with zero Net-new-UTXO.<br>
      Let’s look at an example of what incentives are created by the transaction
      fee calcula‐<br>
      tion, with and without Segregated Witness. We will look at two different
      transactions.<br>
      Transaction A is a 3-input, 2-output transaction, which has a Net-new-UTXO
      metric<br>
      of –1, meaning it consumes one more UTXO than it creates, reducing the
      UTXO set<br>
      by one. Transaction B is a 2-input, 3-output transaction, which has a
      Net-new-UTXO<br>
      metric of 1, meaning it adds one UTXO to the UTXO set, imposing additional
      cost<br>
      on the entire bitcoin network. Both transactions use multisignature
      (2-of-3) scripts to<br>
      demonstrate how complex scripts increase the impact of segregated witness
      on fees.<br>
      Let’s assume a transaction fee of 30 satoshi per byte and a 75% fee
      discount on witness<br>
      data:<br>
      Without Segregated Witness<br>
      Transaction A fee: 25,710 satoshi<br>
      Transaction B fee: 18,990 satoshi<br>
      With Segregated Witness<br>
      Transaction A fee: 8,130 satoshi<br>
      Transaction B fee: 12,045 satoshi<br>
      Segregated Witness<br>
      &nbsp;|<br>
      &nbsp;341<br>
      Both transactions are less expensive when segregated witness is
      implemented. But<br>
      comparing the costs between the two transactions, we see that before
      Segregated Wit‐<br>
      ness, the fee is higher for the transaction that has a negative
      Net-new-UTXO. After<br>
      Segregated Witness, the transaction fees align with the incentive to
      minimize new<br>
      UTXO creation by not inadvertently penalizing transactions with many
      inputs.<br>
      Segregated Witness therefore has two main effects on the fees paid by
      bitcoin users.<br>
      Firstly, segwit reduces the overall cost of transactions by discounting
      witness data and<br>
      increasing the capacity of the bitcoin blockchain. Secondly, segwit’s
      discount on wit‐<br>
      ness data corrects a misalignment of incentives that may have
      inadvertently created<br>
      more bloat in the UTXO set.<br>

      pycoin, ku, and tx<br>
      The Python library pycoin, originally written and maintained by Richard
      Kiss, is a<br>
      Python-based library that supports manipulation of bitcoin keys and
      transactions,<br>
      even supporting the scripting language enough to properly deal with
      nonstandard<br>
      transactions.<br>
      The pycoin library supports both Python 2 (2.7.x) and Python 3 (after 3.3)
      and comes<br>
      with some handy command-line utilities, ku and tx.<br>
      Key Utility (KU)<br>
      The command-line utility ku (“key utility”) is a Swiss Army knife for
      manipulating<br>
      keys. It supports BIP-32 keys, WIF, and addresses (bitcoin and alt coins).

      &nbsp;Appendix G: Bitcoin Explorer (bx) Commands<br>
      Examples of bx Command Use<br>
      Let’s look at some examples of using Bitcoin Explorer commands to
      experiment with<br>
      keys and addresses.<br>
      Generate a random “seed” value using the seed command, which uses the
      operating<br>
      system’s random number generator. Pass the seed to the ec-new command to
      generate<br>
      a new private key. We save the standard output into the file private_key:<br>
      $ bx seed | bx ec-new &gt; private_key<br>
      $ cat private_key<br>

      Now, generate the public key from that private key using the ec-to-public
      com‐<br>
      mand. We pass the private_key file into the standard input and save the
      standard out‐<br>
      put of the command into a new file public_key:<br>
      $ bx ec-to-public &lt; private_key &gt; public_key<br>
      $ cat public_key<br>
      02fca46a6006a62dfdd2dbb2149359d0d97a04f430f12a7626dd409256c12be500<br>
      We can reformat the public_key as an address using the ec-to-address
      command.<br>
      We pass the public_key into standard input:<br>
      $ bx ec-to-address &lt; public_key<br>

      Keys generated in this manner produce a type-0 nondeterministic wallet.
      That means<br>
      that each key is generated from an independent seed. Bitcoin Explorer
      commands<br>
      can also generate keys deterministically, in accordance with BIP-32. In
      this case, a<br>
      “master” key is created from a seed and then extended deterministically to
      produce a<br>
      tree of subkeys, resulting in a type-2 deterministic wallet.<br>
      First, we use the seed and hd-new commands to generate a master key that
      will be<br>
      used as the basis to derive a hierarchy of keys:<br>
      $ bx seed &gt; seed<br>
      $ cat seed<br>
      eb68ee9f3df6bd4441a9feadec179ff1<br>
      $ bx hd-new &lt; seed &gt; master<br>
      $ cat master<br>

      beiTcDzd23mAoyizm9cApe51gNfLMkBqkYoWWMCRwzfuJk8RwF1SVEpAQ<br>
      We now use the hd-private command to generate a hardened “account” key and
      a<br>
      sequence of two private keys within the account:<br>
      $ bx hd-private --hard &lt; master &gt; account<br>
      $ cat account<br>
      xprv9vkDLt81dTKjwHB8fsVB5QK8cGnzveChzSrtCfvu3aMWvQaThp59ueu-<br>

      ziCRJru9n6tzEWrASVpEdrZrFidt1RDfn4yA3<br>
      Next, we use the hd-public command to generate the corresponding sequence
      of two<br>
      public keys:<br>
      $ bx hd-public --index 0 &lt; account<br>
      xpub6BH1zcTuk-<br>

      MaMV1cn7nUPUkgQHPVXJVqsrA8xWbGQDhohEcDFTEYMvYzwRD7Juf8<br>
      The public keys can also be derived from their corresponding private keys
      using the<br>
      hd-to-public command:<br>
      $ bx hd-private --index 0 &lt; account | bx hd-to-public<br>
      xpub6BH1zcTuk-<br>

      MaMV1cn7nUPUkgQHPVXJVqsrA8xWbGQDhohEcDFTEYMvYzwRD7Juf8<br>
      We can generate a practically limitless number of keys in a deterministic
      chain, all<br>
      derived from a single seed. This technique is used in many wallet
      applications to gen‐<br>
      erate keys that can be backed up and restored with a single seed value.
      This is easier<br>
      than having to back up the wallet with all its randomly generated keys
      every time a<br>
      new key is created.<br>
      The seed can be encoded using the mnemonic-encode command:<br>
      $ bx hd-mnemonic &lt; seed &gt; words<br>
      adore repeat vision worst especially veil inch woman cast recall dwell
      appreci-<br>
      ate<br>
      The seed can then be decoded using the mnemonic-decode command:<br>
      $ bx mnemonic-decode &lt; words<br>
      eb68ee9f3df6bd4441a9feadec179ff1<br>
      Mnemonic encoding can make the seed easier to record and even remember.<br>

      Andreas M. Antonopoulos is a noted technologist and serial entrepreneur
      who has<br>
      become one of the most well-known and well-respected figures in bitcoin.
      As an<br>
      engaging public speaker, teacher, and writer, Andreas makes complex
      subjects acces‐<br>
      sible and easy to understand. As an advisor, he helps startups recognize,

      computer sci‐<br>
      ence, data communications, and distributed systems from University College
      London<br>
      (UCL)—recently ranked among the world’s top 10 universities. After moving
      to the<br>
      United States, Andreas cofounded and managed a successful technology
      research<br>
      company, and in that role advised dozens of Fortune 500 company executives
      on net‐<br>
      working, security, data centers, and cloud computing. More than 200 of his
      articles on<br>
      security, cloud computing, and data centers have been published in print
      and syndi‐<br>
      cated worldwide. He holds two patents in networking and security.<br>
      In 1990, Andreas started teaching various IT topics in private,
      professional, and aca‐<br>
      demic environments. He honed his speaking skills in front of audiences
      ranging in<br>
      size from five executives in a boardroom to thousands of people in large
      conferences.<br>
      With more than 400 speaking engagements under his belt he is considered a
      world-<br>
      class and charismatic public speaker and teacher. In 2014, he was
      appointed as a<br>
      teaching fellow with the University of Nicosia, the first university in
      the world to offer<br>
      a masters degree in digital currency. In this role, he helped develop the
      curriculum<br>
      and cotaught the Introduction to Digital Currencies course, offered as a
      massive open<br>
      online course (MOOC) through the university.<br>
      As a bitcoin entrepreneur, Andreas has founded a number of bitcoin
      businesses and<br>
      launched several community open source projects. He serves as an advisor
      to several<br>
      bitcoin and cryptocurrency companies. He is a widely published author of
      articles<br>

      The animal on the cover of Mastering Bitcoin is a leafcutter ant (Atta
      colombica). The<br>
      leafcutter ant (a nongeneric name) is a tropical, fungus-growing ant
      endemic to<br>
      South and Central America, Mexico, and southern United States. Aside from<br>
      humans, leafcutter ants form the largest and most complex animal societies
      on the<br>
      planet. They are named for the way they chew leaves, which serve as
      nutrition for<br>
      their fungal garden.<br>
      Winged ants, both male and female, take part in a mass exit of their nest
      known as<br>
      the revoada, or a nuptial flight. Females mate with multiple males to
      collect the 300<br>
      million sperm necessary to set up a colony. Females also store bits of the
      parental fun‐<br>
      gus garden mycelium in the infrabuccal pocket located in their oral
      cavity; they will<br>
      use this to start their own fungal gardens. Once grounded, the female
      loses its wings<br>
      and sets up an underground lair for her colony. The success rate for new
      queens is<br>
      low: 2.5% establish a long-lived colony.<br>
      Once a colony has matured, ants are divided into castes based on size,
      with each caste<br>
      performing various functions. There are usually four castes: minims, the
      smallest<br>
      workers that tend to the young and fungus gardens; minors, slightly larger
      than min‐<br>
      ima, are the first line of defense for the colony and patrol the
      surrounding terrain and<br>
      attack enemies; mediae, the general foragers that cut leaves and bring
      back leaf frag‐<br>
      ments to the nest; and majors, the largest worker ants that act as
      soldiers, defending<br>
      the nest from intruders. Recent research has shown that majors also clear
      main forag‐<br>
      ing trails and carry bulky items back to the nest.<br>
